Reimu:
It's been a while since my last job.

Reimu:
It sure feels great out.
There aren't many evil spirits about during the day, so I'm trying my luck at night...
But it's dark out, and I'm not sure where to go.
Still...
It's so romantic out behind the shrine at night. (‚Üê carefree)

???:
You said it! Monsters come out too, so it's simply wonderful.

Reimu:
Um, who are you?

Rumia:
We just meet a few moments ago. Could you be night-blind?

Reimu:
Humans can't see very well in the dark in the first place.

Rumia:
Oh? I feel like I've seen people who only work at night.

Reimu:
I have no problem with you 
grabbing them and eating them for dinner.

Rumia:
Ohhhh...Is that soooo...

Reimu:
You know, you're in my way.

Rumia:
Is the person in front of me the edible kind?

Reimu:
Have you ever heard the saying "good medicine tastes bad"?

Reimu:
Of course, you wouldn't know if it's good medicine or not unless you drank it for yourself.

Reimu:
Was this lake always this big?
This mist is annoying. I can't see through it.
Maybe I just have a bad sense of direction?

Cirno:
When you lose your way, it's because of the fairies.

Reimu:
Oh, really? Could you show me the way, then? There was an island around here, right?

Cirno:
Hey, be a bit more surprised. Don't you see a formidable enemy right in front of you?

Reimu:
You're a target? Now that is a surprise.

Cirno:
Quit teasing meeee.
I'll deep-freeze you with some English beef!!

Reimu:
Ah, it's gotten chilly out.
I'll catch an air conditioner cold at this rate.

???:
Damn. Time for my last stand combat formation!

Reimu:
You're going to set up a formation all by yourself?

???:
Stop following meeee.

Reimu:
Thanks for showing me the wayyyy.

Meiling:
You know, you can follow me all you want, but there's nothing over there.

Reimu:
You wouldn't flee to the middle of nowhere, right?

Meiling:
Well, if I was running away, I probably wouldn't be picky about where.

Reimu:
By the way, who are you?

Meiling:
Er, just a normal person.

Reimu:
But didn't you attack me before?

Meiling:
I attacked normally. But you attacked me first.
You're the one who's abnormal.

Reimu:
I'm just a normal person who works as a shrine maiden.

Meiling:
That's good to hear. If I remember correctly...

Meiling:
...they say that shrine maidens are the kind of human it's okay to eat...

Reimu:
Don't spread sayings like that!

Reimu:
Well then, I'll have you show me the way.

Meiling:
There's no more past this. Since this is the demo.

Reimu:
Oh well, that's too bad.

Reimu:
Well then, I'll have you show me the way.

Meiling:
I'm so sorry, mistress...

Reimu:
Aren't there any windows in this house?
And did it even look this big from the outside?

???:
You, the red-white one!
There is no rampaging around in my study.

Reimu:
Study? (Red-white?)

Patchouli:
The books here are worth all the donations your shrine has received in the past five years.

Reimu:
My shrine gets no visitors all year round.

Patchouli:
Oh. Then I suppose they're not worth much.

Reimu:
Anyway, can you actually read in such a dark room?

Patchouli:
Unlike you, I'm not night-blind.

Reimu:
I'm telling youuuu, I'm not night-blind.
...Right, so what I meant to say was, are you the owner of this house?

Patchouli:
What do you need from the mistress?

Reimu:
There's too much mist outside. It's a problem.

Patchouli:
Then I absolutely cannot allow you to see the mistress.

Reimu:
I won't let you stop me.

Patchouli:
...By the way, just who are you?

Reimu:
But really, did the mansion look this big from the outside?

Patchouli:
There is someone in the mansion who likes to mess with space.

???:
Ah, the cleaning isn't getting anywhere!
The mistress will be angry with me!!

???:
You're getting in the way of my cleaning again...

Reimu:
You...
don't seem to be the owner.

Sakuya:
What is it? Are you a guest of the mistress?

Reimu:
(She probably won't let me pass if I tell her that I came to defeat her mistress.)

Sakuya:
You may not pass.
The mistress rarely meets with people.

Reimu:
Is she under house arrest?

Sakuya:
My mistress likes dark places.

Reimu:
Then a not-so-dark person like you will do.
You're the ones spreading this mist all over the place, right?
It's a nuisance. What are you trying to do?

Sakuya:
Daylight is bothersome. The mistress prefers the dark.

Reimu:
But I don't. Would you stop it?

Sakuya:
Ask the mistress yourself.

Reimu:
Then call her here.

Sakuya:
And why would I place the mistress in danger?

Reimu:
Will she come if I cause trouble here?

Sakuya:
You've already caused enough.

Sakuya:
Even so, you cannot meet with my mistress.
I can stall you for as long as it takes by stopping time.

Reimu:
How's that!?

Sakuya:
Why are you so full of yourself, at this level? You have a long way to go.
Come back two hours earlier.

Reimu:
Now I wonder if you'll let me meet with the mistress.

Sakuya:
She's strong... But maybe the mistress can...

Sakuya:
I've got to at least make you waste a bomb before the mistress gets mad at me...

Reimu:
Can't you be quiet and go run some errands?

Reimu:
Isn't it about time you showed yourself?
"Mistress"?

Remilia:
I knew it. Humans are useless.

Reimu:
Was that maid really human?

Remilia:
You. You're the murderer.

Reimu:
Don't worry, it was only one person, so it's not like I'm a serial killer.

Remilia:
Well?

Reimu:
Oh right, you're being a huge nuisance.

Remilia:
How quick you are to accuse. And I don't even know why.

Reimu:
Whatever, could you just leave?

Remilia:
This is my castle, is it not?
You are the one who will leave.

Reimu:
I want you to leave this world.

Remilia:
So that's how it's going to be.
I am already full, but...

Reimu:
Didn't you hire that maid to protect you?
I can take a sheltered girl like you down in one blow!

Remilia:
Sakuya is an excellent cleaner.
Not a single head is on the floor, thanks to her.

Reimu:
Are you strong?

Remilia:
Who knows. I don't get to go outside often.
Since I'm weak to sunlight.

Reimu:
... So you're strong, then.

Remilia:
The moon is so red tonight... I will end your life for real.

Reimu:
The moon is so red, but...

Remilia Reimu:
Looks like it's going to be a fun night. Looks like it's going to be a long night.

Marisa:
This kinda feeling, it's...
Knowing her, she'd probably say, "It sure feels great".
I hate the night, though.
There's only weirdos around at this hour.

???:
Who are you calling a weirdo?

Marisa:
Nobody said anything about you.

Rumia:
Um, no, of course not.

Marisa:
So, why are you stretching out your arms like that?

Rumia:
Doesn't it look like it says "The saint was crucified on the cross"?

Marisa:
Looks more to me like "Man has adopted the decimal system."

Marisa:
Do non-humans
not have ten fingers?

Marisa:
I'm sure the island was around here...
Could it be moving?
That aside...
It's the middle of summer. Why's it so cold?

Cirno:
You'll never walk upon land again!

Marisa:
So you were the cold one.

Cirno:
Better than being hot, don't you think?

Marisa:
Gee, that was a cool pun.

Cirno:
No, I didn't mean...

Marisa:
That's the best you can do, isn't it?

Marisa:
Ah, these short sleeves are bad for my body.
I should find a mansion that serves tea soon.

???:
Damn, gotta run for now!

Marisa:
See ya later.

???:
Ah, thanks back there.

Marisa:
Long time no see.

Meiling:
Hey, since when have we known each otherrrr.

Marisa:
Since just before, remember?

Meiling:
Hmm. I did run into some weirdo, didn't I.

Marisa:
Whatever, you're in the way. Aren't you the guard around here?

Meiling:
You know, a guard's job is to get in the way.

Marisa:
So you are the guard, after all?

Meiling:
No, I'm just a normal person who happens to be guarding.

Marisa:
So then you're a normal person. Then I'll punish you right here.

Meiling:
What kind of an education did you have?

Marisa:
Just as I thought, fighting normal people doesn't suit me.

Meiling:
That had to be a lie...

Marisa:
Whoa, so many books.
I'll take some on my way out later.

???:
Don't carry them off...

Marisa:
I'm gonna carry 'em off.

Patchouli:
Let's see... How to take out the black thing in front of me without having to do anything...

Marisa:
(That is actually written in there?)

Patchouli:
Hmm, my eyes have gotten worse lately.

Marisa:
Isn't that because the room is so dark?

Patchouli:
Perhaps I have an iron deficiency.

Marisa:
If anything, it's vitamin A.

Patchouli:
How about you?

Marisa:
I have enough. Of a lot of things.

Patchouli:
Then maybe I'll help myself.

Marisa:
I'm really tasty.

Patchouli:
Let's see... How to easily remove the impurities from my ingredients...

Marisa:
Seems like magic's your thing. Anything else you got up your sleeves?

Patchouli:
(sob sob) I can't finish reciting the spells because of my anemia.

???:
Ah, the cleaning isn't getting anywhere!
The mistress will be angry with me!!

???:
You're getting in the way of my cleaning again...

Marisa:
Oh dear, a maid.
I'll be arrested under the Washington Convention if I catch you.

Sakuya:
Ah, magicians are actually in greater need of mercy.

Marisa:
Have mercy.

Sakuya:
So?
Were you also hired to work here?

Marisa:
Ah, that sounds like it could be nice.

Sakuya:
But you don't look like you could even clean.

Marisa:
I can't.

Sakuya:
Then, what will you be in charge of? Love duties?

Marisa:
More like building repairs.

Sakuya:
That's silly. We're not in elementary school anymore.

Marisa:
So love duty belongs in junior high?

Sakuya:
Well then, I'll have you start working immediately.
I forgot to introduce myself. I am Sakuya, the chief maid.

Marisa:
So if I beat you, I become chief maid, right?

Sakuya:
More people have said that and been killed by me than there are thorium decay products.

Marisa:
Ah. That must happen a lot, then.

Sakuya:
Your time, too, is mine... An old-fashioned witch doesn't stand a chance.

Marisa:
Aah, I'm tired.

Sakuya:
Then why don't you go home? I have a job to do.

Marisa:
All right, I will.

Sakuya:
Really? Bye.

Marisa:
Can I become the chief maid without actually being a maid?

Sakuya:
Of course you can't.

Sakuya:
We don't see people like you around here often. There's nothing here, okay?

Marisa:
Right back atcha. Are you really even a maid?

Marisa:
There's definitely something here. This eerie atmosphere is giving me the chills.
Why do the strong ones always hide?

Remilia:
A skilled hawk does not hide... its tail.

Marisa:
...You don't seem to have skills or brains.

Remilia:
Humans are the only ones
who need simple chemical thought centers such as brains.

Marisa:
You're one of those, right?
Can't stand sunlight or smelly vegetables,
or silver things.
The masters of the night, which for some reason have tons of weaknesses...

Remilia:
Yes, I am indeed a sickly girl.

Marisa:
Seems interesting. So you really drink it? You know, that.

Remilia:
Of course I do. But I'm a light eater, so I always leave some.

Marisa:
How many people's blood have you sucked up until now?

Remilia:
Can you remember how many slices 
of bread you have eaten until now?

Marisa:
Thirteen. I prefer Japanese food.

Remilia:
So, what are you here for?
I'm already quite full, but...

Marisa:
I see. Well, I'm hungry.

Remilia:
...Help yourself, then.

Marisa:
Ah, is that so.
Just now, that was the name of a flower: "aas≈çkai."

Remilia:
Humans are such fun.
Or maybe you're not a human?

Marisa:
I'm a fun human.

Remilia:
Fufufu. Is it because the moon is so red?

Remilia Marisa:
It looks like it's going to be a hot night. Looks like it's gonna be a cold night.

Patchouli:
What? You are here again?

Reimu:
I'm here again.

Patchouli:
My asthma isn't bad today,
so I'll show you my best magic!

Reimu:
Today is unusually hot.
Are they attacking more violently
because of that girl who went crazy before?

???:
How naive! You there, red-white!

Reimu:
There's another crazy one?

Flandre:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Reimu:
Who are you? I don't think you were here when I came last time...

Flandre:
I was, but you couldn't see me. So, are you a human?

Reimu:
Yes, that's right.

Flandre:
You're not trying to trick me, are you?
I've only ever seen humans in the form of a drink.

Reimu:
Yes, I'm actually human.
Humans are a bit more complicated than black tea. Most of them are, anyway.

Flandre:
But, chickens...

Reimu:
Huh?

Flandre:
...even if you don't know how to cook them, they're still tasty.

Reimu:
And who makes food out of humans in your household?

Flandre:
I dunno? I don't think my sister does...

Reimu:
Sister?
Replica-somethingorother, the devil?

Flandre:
Remilia! My sister Remilia.

Reimu:
I doubt that your sister can cook at all.

Flandre:
She doesn't.

Reimu:
There's something I want to tell you.
Your older sister keeps intruding on my shrine and being a nuisance.
Could you do something about it?

Flandre:
I know.
I wanted to go too...

Reimu:
Don't.

Flandre:
I couldn't. It was raining too hard.

Reimu:
You've got special needs, it seems. Did you do something bad in the past?

Flandre:
I couldn't have done anything.
I haven't gone out even once in the past 495 years.

Reimu:
A real problem child.

Flandre:
I have a play toy over here...

Reimu:
What do you want to play?

Flandre:
The danmaku game.

Reimu:
Oh, the pattern-making game. I'm pretty good at that.

Reimu:
See? This is the power of those who serve gods!

Flandre:
Don't go thinking you won with that.
There's still more to come!

Reimu:
!?
Er, you're in really bad shape though.

Flandre:
Yes, I can't even shoot smoke anymore...

Reimu:
I'll come play whenever you want.
So please, don't come to the shrine.

Flandre:
Oh, and I was thinking of visiting you with cake and tea, as thanks.

Reimu:
Try not to bring your kind of food to a human's place.

Flandre:
It's not too sweet, is it?

Reimu:
Not even if it's sugar-free!
Be a good girl. Go back home and go to sleep.

Flandre:
...But this is my house.

Reimu:
So you don't need to go home. Fitting for a bad girl.
I'm going home now.

Flandre:
Bad girls don't need to go home.

Reimu:
...I left another bad girl at the shrine, after all.

Flandre:
Who do you mean, bad girl?

Reimu:
You and your sister!!

Patchouli:
What? You are here again?

Marisa:
You? Are you the one responsible for this?

Patchouli:
I don't have time for this...
First, the little sister, and now you. This is the worst day ever!

Marisa:
What's going on around here?
Remilia should be at the shrine right now.
So why's everyone attacking me this intensely?

???:
Did someone call me?

Marisa:
Nope.

???:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Marisa:
Who're you?

???:
Before you ask for a person's name...

Marisa:
Oh, me?
Right, I'm Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden.

Flandre:
I am Flandre, Miss Marisa. (You could never be a shrine maiden.)

Marisa:
And what are you? (Maybe I shoulda said nurse?)

Flandre:
I've been in this house the whole time.
Even the last time you barged in here.

Marisa:
You were?

Flandre:
I've been sleeping in the basement.
For about 495 years.

Marisa:
Cool, I only get weekends off.

Flandre:
I heard that you often quarreled with my elder sister.

Marisa:
Elder sister? So you're her younger sister.

Flandre:
I wanted to see one of these "humans", so I tried to go outside.

Marisa:
Well, ain't you in luck. Here, look as much as you like.

Flandre:
Will you play with me?

Marisa:
What's it worth to ya?

Flandre:
One coin.

Marisa:
One coin? You can't even buy a life with that.

Flandre:
I meant you can't use a continue!

Marisa:
Satisfied now?

Flandre:
This can't be true. I can't believe I actually lost...

Marisa:
Yeah, it might be less true than you think.
I'm gonna go home for the day.

Flandre:
Yes, I'm satsified.
But in the end I'll be all alone again.

Marisa:
‚ô™!
If you're alone, does that mean you'll hang yourself?

Flandre:
Why should I?

Marisa:
She went and hanged herself
 and then there were none.
(One hanged herself and then there were none.)

Flandre:
Where did you hear that...?

Marisa:
It's a famous nursery rhyme.

Flandre:
I had planned for you to be the last one.

Marisa:
Right, when you went invisible during that attack before.

Flandre:
She died by the bullet
 and then there were none.
(One couldn't dodge the bullets and then there were none.)

Marisa:
Sorry to disappoint you. Unfortunately, I'm pretty good at dodging.

Flandre:
Well, it doesn't matter. I can't die, even if I hang myself.

Marisa:
A hanged corpse is pretty ugly.
Why don't you do as the real song says?

Flandre:
The real song?

Marisa:
Wait, you don't know?
She got married and then there were none...

Flandre:
Marry who?

Marisa:
I'll introduce ya to a girl at a shrine.

Reimu:
It's so cold...
When will this be over?
This is supposed to be the season for sleeping.

???:
"In spring one sleeps a sleep that knows no dawn," was it?

Reimu:
If I had to guess, I'd say it is time for your kind's eternal sleep.

Letty:
Don't humans sleep during winter? I mean, you're mammals, after all.

Reimu:
Some people do, but I don't.

Letty:
Then I'll help you go to sleep. A deep and peaceful sleep.

Reimu:
Oh, but for a nice deep sleep, it needs to be much warmer.

Letty:
If you sleep when it's warm, then you're just like us, aren't you? Like the asebi flowers, too.

Reimu:
Shut up! If your kind would just go to sleep, it would warm up already!

Reimu:
That didn't warm me up very much.
She could have at least attacked a bit more fiercly.

Reimu:
Hold on,
did there use to be houses here?

???:
Straying into here means the end!

Reimu:
The end?

Chen:
Anyway, welcome to Mayohiga!

Reimu:
The end of what?

Chen:
Once you wander in, you can never return.

Reimu:
I see.
Well, I'm certain I've heard that items from Mayohiga will bring you luck if you take them home...

Chen:
They will.

Reimu:
Well then, the plundering starts n„Éº

Chen:
What!?

Chen:
This is our home. Would you mind leaving, human?

Reimu:
Whatever happened to "Once you wander in, you can never return"?

Reimu:
First of all,
I'll look around for some easy-to-carry everday necessities.

Reimu:
It's really cold out tonight...
And I can't see a thing.

???:
Is your level of spring insufficient even to push away this cold?

Reimu:
Well, that might be true.

Alice:
It's been a while.

Reimu:
We've only just met.

Alice:
No, that's not what I meant.

Reimu:
Am I supposed to remember?

Alice:
Don't you remember me? Well, either way is fine though.

Reimu:
Setting that aside, what did you mean by "level of spring"?

Alice:
I was referring to the springtime in your head.

Reimu:
I hope mine's not too high.
Still, why has this winter been so long?

Alice:
There's someone who's gathering the spring.

Reimu:
And you have nothing to do with it?

Alice:
Of course not.

Reimu:
Bye.

Alice:
Hey!

Alice:
And we've only just met after so long, old friend. Have you only brought me your life as a gift?

Reimu:
And why am I being called "old friend" by this seven-colored magical moron?

Alice:
In the end, shrine maidens are two colors.
Your power is only twenty-eight-point-five-seven-one-four percent as powerful as mine.

Reimu:
By "spring",
were you referring to these cherry petals?

Alice:
You were gathering them without knowing it?

Reimu:
No, I mean, uh... yes.

Reimu:
So anyhow...
Why are cherry blossoms fluttering up above the clouds?
...
...
Doesn't someone usually pop out with a response at a time like this?

???:
Yeah, ok.

Lunasa:
See, it's that.
Around here when the season changes the atmospheric pressure...
lowers.

Reimu:
It looks like our excitement is about to lower as well.

Lunasa:
...

Reimu:
Hey, I have business here. I'm not going home yet.

Lunasa:
Nobody's telling you to.
I just meant that there are ascending air currents, you see.

Reimu:
I mean, it just seems that my destination lies behind this gate.

???:
You're hurrying too much, sister.

Merlin:
And who is that?

Lunasa:
An ascending air current.

Lyrica:
Our natural enemy„Éº

Reimu:
Perhaps not.
So, what the hell are you people? And what is this place anyway?

Lyrica:
We are the Poltergeist Musical Performance Ensemble~ We were called here.

Merlin:
There will be a cherry blossom viewing at the mansion. We will enliven it with music.

Lunasa:
You, however, can't perform.

Reimu:
But I wanna go flower-viewing, too.

Merlin:
You have not been invited.

Reimu:
Invited by phantoms? I wouldn't like that anyway.

Lunasa:
Unwanted noise should be drowned out.

Lyrica:
Good luck~

Lunasa:
Any assistance will be welcome.

Reimu:
Alright! I can attend the flower-view event!

Sisters:
So, is your purpose "Hijacking the flower-view event"?

Reimu:
I feel like something is wrong...

???:
You're a human, I see.
Just what I needed.
I shall drain every drop
of the spring from you!

Reimu:
This ominous feeling...
doesn't make me happy at all.

???:
So this is why everyone here is noisy...

Youmu:
...it must be because of a living human.

Reimu:
...Don't tell me this place...

Youmu:
This is the place where the used-to-be-living reside.

Reimu:
The world of the dead? I see I've been invited somehow.

Youmu:
You have not yet been invited.

Reimu:
In any case...
How can a normal person enter the world of the dead so easily? That's just too dangerous.

Youmu:
You broke the barrier on the way here, didn't you!?

Reimu:
That one opened right up.

Youmu:
That barrier was a "Do not enter" sign...
You're like a kid climbing a pole that says "Don't climb".
Selfishly tearing it, then saying "That's just too dangerous"? Nonsense.

Reimu:
You're quite a talkative phantom.

Youmu:
I'm half non-phantom!

Reimu:
That's what needed correction?

Youmu:
At any rate, with just a little more spring,
the Saigyou Ayakashi will soon reach full bloom.
The small trace of spring that you've brought here...
will give us the last step needed.

Reimu:
You're quite a talkative half-phantom.

Youmu:
Were you listening to me?
I'm going to cut you down here, and you'll meet your end.

Reimu:
If I die in the world of the dead, would I still be sent to the world of the dead?

Youmu:
You will be sent to hell.

Reimu:
Oh, so this place is not hell is it?

Youmu:
The things that cannot be cut by my Roukanken, forged by youkai...
are next to none!

Reimu:
There's enough spring in this place already.
What else are you trying to do?

Youmu:
The young mistress would like to see perfect cherry blossoms this year.
This level of spring is not enough for the Saigyou Ayakashi to bloom fully...

Reimu:
And is a full bloom a... good thing?

Youmu:
Don't step any further!
Believe me, the young mistress will not hesitate to kill!

Reimu:
Kill who, exactly? You?

Reimu:
Geez!
I'm so fed up with all these phantoms.

???:
Selfishly stepping into someone's garden only to speak complaints.

Reimu:
!?

???:
That's not normal.

Yuyuko:
Sure, my home is full of phantoms, yes.

Reimu:
Now, what was my business here again? The lovely cherry blossoms distracted me.

Yuyuko:
Did you come for cherry blossom viewing?
We do have a few empty places.

Reimu:
Oh, really? Well then, let's go have a look.

Yuyuko:
You still are not invited, dear.

Reimu:
Ah, yes, yes, I remember.

Yuyuko:
Remember what?

Reimu:
I'd rather have a flower-viewing event at my shrine.

Yuyuko:
...

Reimu:
While it's true the flowers here are beautiful,
would you kindly return the spring you stole?

Yuyuko:
Just a little longer.
A little longer and the Saigyou Ayakashi will be in full bloom...

Reimu:
Just what is this Saigyou Ayakashi?

Yuyuko:
Our youkai cherry tree.
We still don't have enough spring to break the seal on its blossom.

Reimu:
It's been intentionally sealed up,
so it's probably better not to mess with it, right?
Besides, we don't know what's sealed in it.

Yuyuko:
How can you say that after breaching through our barrier?

Reimu:
Yeah, whatever. So, what happens if you break this seal?

Yuyuko:
A perfect bloom will occur.

Reimu:
...

Yuyuko:
And at that time, a certain someone will be revived.

Reimu:
Reviving people just for curiosity isn't good. And again, we don't know who will be revived at all.

Yuyuko:
Oh, I can invite humans and youkai to their deaths just for curiosity.

Reimu:
Being able to bring death doesn't mean you know anything about bringing life.
What if you revive something really nasty?

Yuyuko:
We can't know before we try.
And in any case, uninvited girl,
being here at this point in time is same as being dead.
Or more precisely, being here means you have died.

Reimu:
Even if I'm dead, I can go flower-viewing.

Yuyuko:
If I could just have that bit of spring that you carry within you...
I could see real cherry blossoms... ...with that "certain someone".

Reimu:
Alright, enough joking around.
I will now take back Gensokyo's spring.

Yuyuko:
You should have said so from the start.

Reimu:
It was the second thing I said from the beginning.

Yuyuko:
The conclusion is the most important part.

Reimu Yuyuko:
Return beneath the flowers, ghost of spring! 
Sleep beneath the flowers, red-white butterfly!

Marisa:
What the hell am I doing here?
It's easy to become lost in the winter mountains of snow.

???:
And do you know why it is so easy to lose your way?

Marisa:
Because in winter, there aren't any mountains without snow.

Letty:
That's right. Are you also a lost soul?

Marisa:
Nah, I'm ordinary.

Letty:
Poor thing, done in by the cold.

Marisa:
So it seems. This should be a season when humans nap beneath cherry trees.

Letty:
The winter is indeed long this year. I also want a long, deep, carefree sleep.

Marisa:
Hold on, if you sleep in this cold you will be killed.

Marisa:
If I can defeat even this kind of opponent,
maybe spring will return a little bit at a time?

Marisa:
Ahhh...
Something human-like seems to live here.
A cat? A dog? A fox?

???:
I hear the voices calling~...

Marisa:
"Go farther and fare worse," eh?

Chen:
So, what is your purpose here?

Marisa:
Nothing to do with four-legged creatures.

Chen:
You have reached the Village of the Lost. Have you lost your way?

Marisa:
I never had any way to lose.

Chen:
Visibility was was horrible in that snowstorm, and the winds were changing by the moment.

Marisa:
The winds were changing? I see. No wonder...

Chen:
And now you don't know the way back.

Marisa:
No wonder.

Marisa:
No wonder.
I keep running into all these randos.

Marisa:
It seems...
...comfortable here.

???:
Do you find this brutal evening likable?

Marisa:
It isn't bad.

Alice:
Then surely you are a magician of the untamed fields.

Marisa:
As opposed to a magician from a greenhouse?

Alice:
As opposed to a magician from a city sect.

Marisa:
Oh„Éº? I get it‚Äîthis is a welcome to the wilderness.

Alice:
Springtime in this rural place is cold and disagreeable.

Marisa:
I think not; some power is at work to cause such snowstorms in spring.

Alice:
It is not my doing, you know.

Marisa:
Is that so?
Even so, it seems that you hold some tiny spring of your own.

Alice:
Well, perhaps I shall partake of your small spring as well?

Marisa:
Have winters always been this busy?
Humans usually stay indoors.

Alice:
You mustn't consider me a normal human.

Marisa:
Are you a weird human, then?

Alice:
I'm normal, just not human!!

Marisa:
This barrier is amazing. There's no way a novice like me can solve its mystery.
Is there something I'm missing?

Lyrica:
Eh, heh, hehÔΩû.

Lyrica:
It's a trade secret.

Marisa:
Au pas, camarade...

Lyrica:
That isn't going to work, kid.

Marisa:
Fine, then. So who are you?

Lyrica:
It doesn't matter, does it?

Marisa:
Yeah, I guess it doesn't.
So, if I defeat you, you'll open the gate?

Lunasa:
Lyrica, is this a friend of yours?

Marisa:
Yeah, a good friend.

Lyrica:
My friend, yes~

Merlin:
Wonderful. At last, Lyrica has made a friend.

Marisa:
Alright, then.
My good friend, would you kindly open this door?

Merlin:
Won't you listen to just one song first, my good friend?

Lunasa:
It's a song of welcome. To a dear new friend.

Lyrica:
Friend~

Marisa:
If I didn't know any better, I'd say you don't plan on opening this barrier.

Lyrica:
Well then, let's start the performanceÔΩû Sisters, get ready!

Merlin:
She's your friend. Play solo for a bit.

Lyrica:
Hey~

Lunasa:
Alright, alright. I'll help you whenever you need.

Marisa:
You don't need more help my friend, do you?

Marisa:
Well, will you open the door?

Sisters:
This door does not open.

Marisa:
Don't you go through it now and then?

Sisters:
We just fly over it.

Marisa:
...Oh.

???:
You're a human, I see.
Just what I needed.
I shall drain every drop
of the spring from you!

Marisa:
Ahh, it's getting a lot warmer.

???:
So this is why all the ghosts here were noisy...

Youmu:
...maybe because a living human has come here.

Marisa:
If I'm a dead human, won't they make noise?

Youmu:
No, not at all.
For a human to have come all the way to Hakugyokurou,
death is the only possible explanation.

Marisa:
Well, I'm alive.

Youmu:
Yet you passed through that barrier with your own will.
It's no wonder the spirits here are making a great clamor at your foolishness.

Marisa:
Well, it's warm here, anyway. Nice and warm.

Youmu:
That is because we have gathered all the spring essence in Gensokyo.
The ordinary cherry blossoms are beyond even the most idealized full bloom.

Marisa:
Dead bodies having a nice flower-viewing. How elegant.

Youmu:
Yet even this immaculate bloom is insufficient for the Saigyou Ayakashi...

Marisa:
Saigyou Ayakashi?

Youmu:
Our pride and joy, our youkai cherry blossom.

Marisa:
I'd like to have a look at that, myself.

Youmu:
In any case, with just a little more spring, our Saigyou Ayakashi will reach full bloom.
The tiny trace of spring that you brought here
will bring us yet another step closer to full bloom.

Marisa:
After all that trouble collecting my spring. I won't hand it to you so easily.

Youmu:
We are one step short of full bloom!

Marisa:
Or better yet, what would you say if I were to snatch away all of your spring
to make those cherry blossoms bloom for myself?

Youmu:
I will not hand over my spring.

Marisa:
Me neither.

Youmu:
The things that cannot be cut by my Roukanken, forged by youkai...
are as good as none!

Marisa:
So, show me the way to the Saigyou Ayakashi, will you?

Youmu:
Anyway, the Saigyou Ayakashi will bloom. So my job is fulfilled.
But I have a bad feeling about this...

Marisa:
Who said I was going to bloom the Saigyou Ayakashi?
I just want to have a flower-viewing.

Youmu:
Don't step any further!
Believe me, the young mistress will not hesitate to kill!

Marisa:
Well, if I don't go any further, I can't exactly hand over my spring to you guys.

Marisa:
Everywhere I go,
everything is in full bloom.

???:
Not yet.
It shall happen soon.

Marisa:
!

???:
With just a little more spring...

Yuyuko:
Even the Saigyou Ayakashi will be in perfect bloom.

Marisa:
I got it right here. That last drop of spring.

Yuyuko:
Ah. Would you like to take Youmu's place, then?

Marisa:
Nah, I wouldn't want to live out the rest of my life in a place like this.

Yuyuko:
How about just a subsitute?

Marisa:
Are you listening to me?

Yuyuko:
I am.
You're saying that when you die, you want to die beneath a cherry tree?

Marisa:
You don't understand what I am saying, do you?

Yuyuko:
Anyway, all I want is to loosen the seal on the Saigyou Ayakashi.

Marisa:
Well, do it, then. Is something good going to happen?

Yuyuko:
Who knows?

Marisa:
Well then, I ain't giving it up for free.

Yuyuko:
What about our flower viewing?
It shall be lively and exciting.

Marisa:
Just a little while, I killed some lively and exciting guys on my way up here...

Yuyuko:
Are the cherry blossoms of the Netherworld not tempting enough for human eyes?

Marisa:
Maybe if this place didn't reek of death.

Yuyuko:
Are you smelling with your eyes?

Marisa:
Yes, exactly.
Damn, this is the first time I see such an irritating spring.

Yuyuko:
You are rude.
The spring that you feel here is none other than the spring of your Gensokyo.

Marisa:
That's rude.
What kind of person can smell with their eyes!?

Yuyuko:
You're lagging behind in the conversation.

Marisa:
Sound travels slowly in the Netherworld.
A place with such a slow speed of sound does not deserve a pleasant spring.

Yuyuko:
What a pity.
I'll turn up the heat and we can continue our chat.

Marisa:
You can do that later...

Yuyuko:
It'll take just a moment‚Äî

Marisa Yuyuko:
I'll take my boring spring, corpse-girl! I'll take your pitiful spring, black witch!

Sakuya:
Ahhhhh, killing the small fry is so pointless!
I wish the one pulling the strings would show up already.

Letty:
Pulling strings, what fun~

Sakuya:
Ahh, so you're the one? 
Well then, without delay.

Letty:
No, wait! 
I'm the mastermind, but I'm normal.

Sakuya:
Mastermind or normal doesn't matter in such a place.
Don't you think this situation isn't normal to begin with?

Letty:
The snow crystals are larger than in past years. 
Three times larger.

Sakuya:
Well, that's true.

Letty:
On top of that, there's a freaky flying maid coming towards me.

Sakuya:
Yeah, that too. 
After all, you're the mastermind.

Sakuya:
That was pitiful.
I'm gonna find the next mastermind, then.

Sakuya:
It really ought to be spring by now...
Or maybe I'm just going crazy.

Chen:
In that case, you'd better ask a human for help!

Sakuya:
But you're not a human.

Chen:
Well, I wouldn't have an answer even if you'd asked me.

Sakuya:
In days like this,
Cats are supposed to docilely curl up beneath a kotatsu.

Chen:
You shouldn't believe such superstitions!

Sakuya:
(I didn't know it was just a superstition...)

Chen:
What are stray cats to do, then?

Sakuya:
Why not get put to sleep at an animal shelter?
The Buddhist Paradise is warm, they say.

Chen:
Humans? Posing a threat to us?
Impossible, impossible, absolutely impossible! 
To think that you would oppose us...

Sakuya:
I, for one, would like to give it a try.

Sakuya:
Amen~
Paradise should definitely be warm, no mistake about it.

Sakuya:
I feel like I'm just wasting my time here...
I wonder how the mistress is doing?

Alice:
Why don't you worry about yourself if you have time to worry about others?

Sakuya:
Oh yes, I'm worried about myself now.

Alice:
So, for what reason do you worry? About yourself.

Sakuya:
Because I'm carrying only three changes of clothes. 
For myself.

Alice:
Ah, good reason.

Sakuya:
That, and a spare set of knives too.

Alice:
Ah, I... KNIVES?

Sakuya:
You seem to have few worries. Isn't that nice.

Alice:
How rude!
I don't have few worries, I have none!

Sakuya:
Well, if you want to put it that way.
So, you, who has no worries.

Alice:
Yes?

Sakuya:
Do you know who it was that stole spring or sprinkled winter all over this land?

Alice:
I might happen to have some general idea about that.

Sakuya:
Where are they?

Alice:
Such trifling information rarely concerns me.

Sakuya:
It is not a trifle.

Sakuya:
Alright, spill it. Who's behind this whole affair?

Alice:
Downwind, there's a decadent Shinto shrine.
There's a shrine maiden there who dreams of spring... 
I bet she's behind all this.

Sakuya:
Somehow, I doubt that very much.

Alice:
Well, joking aside.
Haven't you noticed that the spring follows you as you gather cherry petals?

Sakuya:
...I bet it's upwind then.

Alice:
I haven't said my point yet...

Sakuya:
Oh, it's so much warmer in the sky.
It's so wonderful that I could cry...

Merlin:
So true~
Furious snowstorms rage beneath these clouds.

Sakuya:
Um, where is this place? 
And who are you?

Merlin:
One question at a time, please.

Sakuya:
Okay then, is it amazing?

Merlin:
It's amazingly normal.
And not that it matters, but just who are you?

Sakuya:
I have arrived here by struggling upwind against the currents.
It seems the wind stagnates here.

Lunasa:
You are early for the banquet.

Sakuya:
Huh?

Lyrica:
Time for the banquet~

Merlin:
Well, perhaps it might be enough for a petit banquet?

Sakuya:
What? Are you going to have a flower viewing party after this, or something?

Merlin:
Yes, we shall.

Lunasa:
Before that, we might be able to get a hold of stuff for the banquet.

Lyrica:
It is the eve feast of the flower-viewing festival.

Sakuya:
Sounds like fun.

Lunasa:
You are to serve us as food.

Sakuya:
I'm not sure I'm qualified.

Merlin:
No dish has ever escaped my performance alive.

Sakuya:
Hopefully I can make it through okay.

Lyrica:
Dog meat, dog meat~

Sakuya:
Human meat!

Sakuya:
I can't afford to waste time in a place like this.

Sisters:
It's not time for the flower-viewing yet though.

Sakuya:
Flower-viewing would be nice, but spring isn't here yet.

Sisters:
About spring, there's plenty of that in the mansion.

Sakuya:
This kind of barrier...
Is simple to bypass.

???:
You're a human, I see.
Just what I needed.
I shall drain every drop
of the spring from you!

Sakuya:
Come on out.

Youmu:
So this is why everyone here were noisy...
...it's because a living human has come.

Sakuya:
Finally, I've reached the source.
It took me a whole day to get here.

Youmu:
In coming here, you have exercised great composure.
This is Hakugyokurou.
The deceased live on in this place.
Acting on the common sense of the living will land you in a mess.

Sakuya:
The dead tells no tales.
Now, return the spring you stole.

Youmu:
Hold on a bit.

Sakuya:
That's a little bit too long.

Youmu:
Soon, the Saigyou Ayakashi will reach full bloom.
That could never happen with a normal spring.

Sakuya:
I said I don't care.

Youmu:
The trace of spring you brought here could bring the Saigyou Ayakashi to full bloom.

Sakuya:
Are you even listening to me?
I've traveled through that cold only to find such a selfish idea.

Youmu:
But it's warm here, isn't it?

Sakuya:
That's enough already.
Dead people have no mouths.

Youmu:
Indeed, dead people have no mouths.
I will consume the warmth of your spring.

Sakuya:
I wonder, can my knives even cut phantoms?

Youmu:
The things that cannot be cut by my Roukanken, forged by youkai...
are next to none!

Sakuya:
Cool. Looks like these knives actually work.
Maybe because they're silver?

Youmu:
I'm half non-phantom, you know.
But the mistress of this shrine is a fully spirit-bodied.
Do you expect to be a challenge using those obsolete weapons?

Sakuya:
Wait, why are we already talking about that battle?

Youmu:
Don't step any further!
Believe me, the young mistress will not hesitate to kill!

Sakuya:
You sure make a lot of noise for someone who's dead.

Sakuya:
You know...
Doesn't this world have a saying that "the dead have no mouths"?

???:
Oh?
Of course we don't have any such saying.

Sakuya:
!

Yuyuko:
The Netherworld is always lively and gorgeous.

Sakuya:
Isn't it gorgeous because you snatched spring away from Gensokyo?

Yuyuko:
Oh my. You dislike spring?

Sakuya:
No, I'm mad because I LIKE it.
So why did you steal it?

Yuyuko:
I took any spring that was spring.
Still, what we have is not enough.

Sakuya:
...So, that dead girl back there wants me to fight you.

Yuyuko:
Soon, the last cherry blossom, the Saigyou Ayakashi, will bloom.
Then all will be answered...

Sakuya:
That cherry tree... isn't it withering?

Yuyuko:
It's on the verge of blooming.
 Youmu must have thought that the small trace of spring you carry would be enough.

Sakuya:
I don't care.
I am worried that it took me over a day to get here.

Yuyuko:
Well, I'll let you return to your home right away.
You're not to come here yet, anyway.

Sakuya:
I didn't come here just to be sent back.
Return Gensokyo's spring.

Yuyuko:
Oh, could it be that the cherry blossoms in your world have yet to bloom?

Sakuya:
No cherry blossoms; not even the pheasant's eyes bloom.

Yuyuko:
In that case, it'd be troublesome if you developed a heart disease.

Sakuya:
It's not.
First of all, my mistress does not have a weak heart.

Yuyuko:
That's too bad...

Sakuya:
You expected it? 
Well, alright. Enough talk of herbs.
I'm eager to have some warmth.
Return that warmth to us, now.

Yuyuko:
Corpses are beautiful
when they're gathered together in one place.
Same goes for the cherry blossoms and spring...

Sakuya:
First of all, corpses aren't beautiful.

Yuyuko:
I mean...

Sakuya Yuyuko:
I will see flowers, rotting princess! 
I will unseal the tree, dog of the devil!

Chen:
Finally, we meet again.
Today, I have now become...
freshly and newly possessed!

Reimu:
Which part of you is new, then?

Reimu:
If I'd traveled all the way to the land of the dead
only to find what I was looking for wasn't there...
That would totally suck.

???:
Oh? This is rare.

Ran:
They have people like this here too.

Reimu:
What do you mean "like this"?

Ran:
Like you. Propitious sorts clothed in red and white.

Reimu:
First a cat and now a fox... When did this place become an animal realm?

Ran:
Ah, so you're the human who gave Chen a hard time?

Reimu:
What if I am?

Ran:
Chen is my shikigami.
She has recovered, and grown stronger than before.

Reimu:
... She was supposed to be strong?
Wait, she's your shikigami? Aren't you a shikigami yourself?

Ran:
Indeed I am.
My master is still asleep right now.

Reimu:
Ah. So you're the one I'm looking for, then.

Ran:
For what?

Reimu:
Repairing the border between the Netherworld and our world... And...
Come to think of it
For that to happen... I've got to talk to your master.

Ran:
My master is hibernating.

Reimu:
Wake her up.

Ran:
I am also her guardian.
I have no intention of allowing troublemakers to meet with my master.
Now, you will meet your end at the hands of a strengthened Chen...

Reimu:
If you mean that cat, I met her just now...

Ran:
You did? How did that go?

Reimu:
It was nothing special.

Ran:
Well... but she was still recovering...

Reimu:
Didn't you just say that she'd already recovered?

Ran:
...Looks like I have to take revenge for her now.

Reimu:
Just as I expected.
Defeat a shikigami, and maybe its master will wake up...

Ran:
Hey, even my master wakes up eventually...

Reimu:
Well, in the meantime, there's a more immediate obstacle around.

Ran:
I am leagues different from Chen.

Reimu:
Did you think that a shikigami could stand up to a shrine maiden?

Ran:
Why didn't you accept my formula?
That's cheating.

Reimu:
What?

Ran:
I thought for sure that you were only human.

Reimu:
I am human.
Anyway, for all my trouble, you will introduce me to your master.

Ran:
My master, Yukari, is still sleeping...

Reimu:
"Still", you say. When will she awaken?
Spring has already arrived in full.

Ran:
She sleeps through winter and all day. It's still too early for her to wake up.

Reimu:
I think it's already pretty close to dusk...

Ran:
For us it isn't.
When humans go to sleep, that's what we consider the true night.

Reimu:
Whatever, wake her up now.

Ran:
But she isn't here~

Reimu:
So, I shot you down for nothing?

Ran:
And I was shot down for nothing?
So what are you here for anyway?

Reimu:
Well, let's see. Disturbance in the Netherworld, someone's errant shikigami...
Oh yeah, I'm here to punish you.

Ran:
Awww...

Ran:
You again?
I'm tired today.
I was just about to go to sleep...

Reimu:
As promised, I have come at night.

Reimu:
It's high time for the truth to emerge.
The night only gets so dark.

???:
Shall I emerge, then?

???:
Look, I'm here now.

Reimu:
Oh, perfect timing.

Yukari:
You are the human who defeated my Ran?
I cannot sleep knowing that dangerous humans like you exist in this world.

Reimu:
Even so, you sure took your time getting up.

Yukari:
Well... I'm awake now.
And you...

Reimu:
Yeah?

Yukari:
You are from the glorious Hakurei Shrine, are you not?

Reimu:
It's a shrine, yeah, but "glorious" isn't quite right.

Yukari:
That glorious barrier is weakening along the north-east.
If left alone, it might wear out completely.

Reimu:
You're right, that's kind of dangerous. Thanks for letting me know.

Yukari:
No, no, you see, I'm the one trying to tear a hole in it.

Reimu:
Well then, go fix it!

Reimu:
After all, youkai are youkai...
Beating them down and cleaning up afterwards has to be done by a human.

Yukari:
Oh, haven't you noticed?

Reimu:
?

Yukari:
Here, in Hakugyokurou where we stand,
the border between youkai and humans wears thin.
You came this far, and were able to cross over from the human side.

Reimu:
Well then, go fix it now.
It was my intention to make you fix it from the start. And since you'll be doing that anyway...
Having to fix an extra barrier or two won't make much of a difference, right?

Yukari:
An extra barrier or two...
Do you think that there are that few?

Reimu:
Now then, as you promised, get to work.

Yukari:
I was going to do so even without your demands...

Reimu:
Liar.
How much time went to waste while you were lazing off?

Yukari:
That's because I was asleep.

Reimu:
Obviously.

Yukari:
Either way, I'm here now and I'm awake.
That is proof enough that I have the will to work.

Reimu:
"Willing to work" and "getting work done" are entirely different!

Yukari:
Compared to a shrine maiden who's rarely in her shrine, I think I'm getting plenty of work done.

Reimu:
Exorcism is my job.
I should receive hazard pay for my work.

Yukari:
Oh, it's almost dawn.
I have to return home and sleep...

Reimu:
So all in all, you did exactly nothing.
Where on Earth do you live?

Yukari:
The same place as you.
At the edge of Gensokyo.
Along the north-eastern edge.

Reimu:
That's a very ominous direction.
Don't you dare tear a hole in the barrier.

Yukari:
Oh, didn't I say that I already had, before we fought?

Reimu:
Go home and sleep!

Chen:
Finally, we meet again.
Today, I have now become...
freshly and newly possessed!

Marisa:
Well, it's only been ten days.

Marisa:
Ahh,
What's all this commotion?

???:
In this evening, let's do fun banquet preparation again~

Ran:
Ooh, I see a human.

Marisa:
Preparations are fun? You're a weirdo.

Ran:
What are you saying? I mean preparation for "fun baquet".

Marisa:
Well, I mean, some people DO.
Y'know, think that preparing is the most enjoyable part.

Ran:
Anyway, have you seen a cat around these parts, by any chance?
The preparations are actually her job.

Marisa:
If you're talking about Chen, then no, I haven't seen her.

Ran:
Aha! It was you, then! You're the jerk who caused Chen trouble.

Marisa:
How rude. I don't cause anyone trouble.
I only made her something too terrible to look at.

Ran:
Chen is my shikigami.
Though she's shikigami, she's not so cheap.

Marisa:
Shikigamis use shikigamis?
Isn't that vaguely cannibalistic?

Ran:
I don't mean I eat her.

Marisa:
Anyway, so what you're saying is that you, a shikigami, must have a master.
I bet it might be Chen?

Ran:
No way.
My mistress is fast asleep.

Marisa:
Someone who can use a "shikigami that can use a shikigami" is surely interesting.
Mind if I speak to this mistress of yours?

Ran:
I am also her guardian.
And as such I have no intention of letting those who make my shikigami too terrible to look at meet her.

Marisa:
Oh, I get it.
Now I just have to make you too terrible to look at too.

Ran:
I don't get what you think you "get".
Very soon, I will make you too terrible not to just look at but to do anything.

Marisa:
Okay, show yourself you youkai.

Ran:
Gee, she's strong.
No wonder Chen had no chance against her.

Marisa:
Where's your mistress?

Ran:
My mistress, Yukari, is still sleeping.

Marisa:
Ahh?
She doesn't wake up even when her shikigami is in a mess?
Wake her up.

Ran:
You say that, but she is not somewhere nearby~

Marisa:
So you're a long-distance type?
You have quite a bit of power for that type though.

Ran:
What are you talking about?
I've been in shikigami possession for quite a long time.
My power surely exceeds that of average youkai.

Marisa:
Okay, I understand that you're plainly worthless.
What should I do to wake her up?

Ran:
She will at night.
I only see her when she is sleeping, anyway.

Marisa:
So I have to wait till nighttime...
Well, you may go back to your preparation of the fun banquet.

Ran:
...sob sob...

Ran:
You again?
I'm tired today.
I was just about to go to sleep...

Marisa:
You really have dedication.

Marisa:
Strange.
Wicked strange.

???:
What is strange?

???:
The color of the moon this evening? Or...

Marisa:
The moon's brightness.
It's too bright, isn't it?

???:
The moon is caused by a reflection from the sun's light.
That is the only key to the border between day and night.

Marisa:
It will give off light, even during the day or night?

???:
Yes, but it is not because we are above the clouds.

Marisa:
By the way, who are you?

Yukari:
I heard about you from Ran.

Marisa:
The fox boss, right?

Yukari:
Yes, I hear Ran caused some annoyance to you.

Marisa:
To people in the Netherworld, rather than me.

Yukari:
Well, in that case,
I shall continue the rage.

Marisa:
Another annoyance.

Yukari:
You have not yet noticed.

Marisa:
?

Yukari:
This is the night of the new moon.
I hold the border between day and night in the palm of my hand.

Marisa:
Are you a youkai of the night then?

Yukari:
If I hold this power...

Marisa:
or of the dawn?

Yukari:
Soon you will be behind MY barriers.
There within, is neither night nor day.

Marisa:
What, are you the youkai of the night-cherry blossoms then?

Yukari:
The edges of my barriers cannot be found!

Marisa:
Oh, the time is almost sunrise.

Yukari:
And I'm really tired~

Marisa:
That wasn't that hard.

Yukari:
I'm still in bad shape as I've just awakened from my hibernation.

Marisa:
Did you store a lot of honey before hibernation, or something?

Yukari:
Human.

Marisa:
So.

Yukari:
Supposedly Ran takes care of work.
I feel like I had an unpleasant awakening this year.

Marisa:
Maybe because the winter was too long?

Yukari:
Ah, yes, that's why there's a shortage of humans.

Marisa:
Shortage of humans, hmm... is it a correct usage of the word?
...or maybe not.

Yukari:
It's easy for me to manipulate the border between winter and spring...
It's your responsibility that it was taking so long to solve.

Marisa:
I wasn't given responsibility to begin with.
Also, if you manipulate the border, the first spring storm will turn into north wind.

Yukari:
That's right.

Marisa:
On top of that, you'd be awake while you're asleep (hibernating).

Yukari:
You mean noctambulism?
That's my hobby too.

Marisa:
Hobby, eh... It's a kind of syndrome.

Yukari:
No, not myself.
It's humans who get noctambulism.
With me manipulating the border between asleep and awake.

Marisa:
That's really convenient.
So, by the way, isn't it supposed to be morning by now?

Yukari:
It's even closer to another sunset.
Only this place is in night...

Marisa:
Crap, I've got bags under my eyes with this vigil!
You tricked me!

Yukari:
I didn't.

Chen:
Finally, we meet again.
Today, I have now become...
freshly and newly possessed!

Sakuya:
Hey, I've seen this kitty before. Did you die to get here?

Sakuya:
When I look again,
it's really a large garden.

???:
I smell a human~

Ran:
Oh, I'm mistaken.

Sakuya:
No, you aren't.

Ran:
Apparently you're alive...
Well, I'm not really sure. Are you dead?

Sakuya:
Appearance is enough to judge.
And apparently you're a fox.

Ran:
And apparently you're a dog.

Sakuya:
Don't judge something by looks alone.

Ran:
Don't mistake me for a simple beast either.
I am the shikigami of a powerful master.
As such, my powers far exceed those of any youkai you've ever seen...
Not to mention those of humans. Or dogs.

Sakuya:
There's not much difference between shikigami, cats, and foxes.

Ran:
And where'd you see a cat?

Sakuya:
Just back there, near the stairs.

Ran:
That's a great change of subject. 
What do you mean?

Sakuya:
This time, I see a fox.
It's full of animals around here.

Ran:
...So you met Chen?
I've been searching for her.
She is always restless like a cat, and now she's disappeared.

Sakuya:
Too bad for you,
That cat went to the mountain to do laundry.

Ran:
Is that so?
Maybe I should return to the hills too then.

Sakuya:
A fox goes into the hills to die.
As this is the Netherworld, it will be a fitting grave for you.

Ran:
Ha. 
I bet you are the one who tormented Chen, aren't you?
Chen is my shikigami. 
I must take revenge for her.

Sakuya:
She's a youkai's shikigami's shikigami? 
I thought it was something like that.

Sakuya:
Well then, go back to the hills or wherever.

Ran:
Ouch...
Chen's probably depressed too since she's no longer shikigami possessed.

Sakuya:
So I've defeated these annoyances.
However, I sense there's a mastermind of this whole mess.

Ran:
Help me Master Yukari~
This is more than I can handle...

Sakuya:
More annoyance than you can cause?
What exactly is your master doing,
leaving her shikigami running around like this?

Ran:
Sleeping.

Sakuya:
Then wake her up.

Ran:
I have to go back to the hills in order to wake her up.

Sakuya:
So she's not around then...
Master of such an annoying shikigami, eh.
I bet she must be even more annoying than this one.

Ran:
...I don't deny that.

Sakuya:
Anyway, I'll be back when your master is awake.
In the meantime, wake her up properly.

Ran:
You aren't quite making sense.

Sakuya:
Just do it.

Ran:
*sob*

Ran:
You again?
I'm tired today.
I was just about to go to sleep...

Sakuya:
I'll let you really rest in peace this time.

Sakuya:
So, is law enforcement around here
always like this?

???:
There's no law in the world of the dead.

???:
As we can't have a death penalty here, of course.

Sakuya:
Oh, what about the Yama?

???:
One just needs to be stronger than the Yama and they can do as they please.
That's the way of this place... no, of all places.

Sakuya:
Stronger how exactly? Financially?

???:
In cunning.

Sakuya:
Well, to which cunning person am I speaking?

Yukari:
I heard about you from Ran.

Sakuya:
Oh, I've become famous now.

Yukari:
Yes, I've always wanted to meet someone as famous as yourself.

Sakuya:
So much that it woke you right up, I see.
Sorry I can't give you my autograph.

Yukari:
That's alright, your handwritten duplicity would be sufficientÔΩû

Sakuya:
...Handwritten?

Yukari:
You have not yet noticed.

Sakuya:
That you're not cunning at all?

Yukari:
...That the borders between the pure land and hell are fading.
This place has become a lawless land of oni.

Sakuya:
Hell is not as scary as Makai.
Oni, compared to the devil, are nothing at all.

Yukari:
You cannot scurry away;
Beyond here only lies the worst of Hell.

Sakuya:
It's all right, as long as I have one thread of spider's silk,
I can find a way to Heaven.

Yukari:
Hahaha...
Even when the way through my barrage is thinner,
And more intricate than any spider's web?

Sakuya:
Ahh, looks like I'm in heaven.

Yukari:
I never expected anyone could make their way throughÔΩû

Sakuya:
A spider's silk can capture things far larger than the spider itself.
Like, say, a butterfly.

Yukari:
Ah, so that's it. If you see a spider at night,
someone's going to raid your house.

Sakuya:
Don't call me a thief.
Though I suppose with this maid uniform, it's quite unusual to get into trouble.

Yukari:
Well, at least there's nothing worthwhile in my house.
Still worth a lot more than the shrine on the same border though.

Sakuya:
That goes without saying.
You wouldn't have anything in your house if all you ever do is sleep.

Yukari:
That's rude. 
My house is full of nice things.

Sakuya:
That's not what you just said.

Yukari:
My futon, for example.

Sakuya:
Nobody's going to steal that...

Yukari:
And my pillow.

Sakuya:
Okay, so there's nothing really...

Yukari:
But sometimes things wash up on the shore.

Sakuya:
...is there a sea around here?

Yukari:
Like human children. Or adults.

Sakuya:
You'd better return them to where they were.

Reimu:
It really seems like this forest 
gets worse every year. 
I thought it was around here somewhere...

Marisa:
You're right in front of the house, y'know. 
Can't you see what's sitting in right in front of you?

Reimu:
Oh, here it is. I found Marisa's house.

Marisa:
Well, it hasn't gone anywhere or nothin'.

Marisa:
You're a pretty unusual face to see this deep in the forest. 
Somethin' happen?

Reimu:
I just wanted to check on something.

Marisa:
I get it. The reproduction rate of sticky mushrooms predicts moderate luck for today.

Reimu:
Uh, no. Why would I want to check something like that?

Marisa:
Or was it just a little bit of luck?

Reimu:
Marisa, you know the feast happening three days from now? 
You're not hiding anything, are you?

Marisa:
Huh? 
If I said I was hiding somethin', I wouldn't be hidin' it. 
So, I'm not hiding anything! 
Did somethin' happen?

Reimu:
I was just thinking there might be a naughty child around.

Marisa:
Playing hide-and-seek?

Reimu:
I got a really bad feeling at those feasts!

Marisa:
Yeah, but I already said I'm not hidin' anything.

Reimu:
Sigh. Marisa's the same as always.

Marisa:
Hey! What the heck is that supposed to mean?

Reimu:
I still sense that ghostly presence... 
It looks like you weren't hiding anything.

Marisa:
I told you that right from the beginning...

Reimu:
I don't have time to spare for tea, 
so I should get a move on.

Reimu:
Geez, it's gotten dark already. 
I wasted too much time playing with Marisa... 
It's a long way back to the shrine, too. 
I wonder if I'm going the right way.

Alice:
Oh, how unusual for you to be around here! 
Though, humans are unusual here in the first place.

Reimu:
You totally ignored my question.

Alice:
What's that? You're certainly not on the way home!

Reimu:
Right! You're pretty suspicious too.

Alice:
What are you talking about this time?

Reimu:
About how you're the criminal.

Alice:
Er, don't you mean "suspect"? 
And I still don't know what you're talking about.

Reimu:
Haven't you realized it? 
Don't you get what's going on right now? 
And anyway, you're guilty until proven innocent. 
Are you insisting you're not the criminal?

Alice:
I still have no idea what you're talking about... 
Could you be referring to the feasts lately? 
I did think they were a bit strange myself... 
They've been a bit much, haven't they?

Reimu:
It's been really strange. 
However much the others may enjoy partying,
I can't really see you enjoying it.

Alice:
What's that supposed to mean?

Reimu:
Which means that you were the most suspicous one right from the start.

Reimu:
Argh, you're not involved after all! 
What a huge waste of time.

Alice:
You show up out of nowhere, 
treat me like some kind of suspect, 
and then suddenly attack me...

Reimu:
Criminal, not suspect.

Alice:
...Whatever, I don't care anymore.

Reimu:
I've been doing whatever I want from the start! 
By the way, it's pretty dark, and I'm not sure which way goes back...

Reimu:
I've got no clues at all. 
The strange mist appeared so suddenly... 
I can't tell where it came from, or where it's going, or what kind of fog it is. 
It seems like mist, but maybe it's some kind of "space"... 
I haven't come across an enemy with this 
sort of strange presence before. 
It's completely dispersed in a mist... 
Who's doing this? What do they want? 
In any case, we probably haven't noticed the mist 
because we've been too busy having feasts over and over. 
"To hide a leaf, put it in some leaves." 
The fact that no one is complaning about the feasts 
is the most suspicious part of this.

Youmu:
Are you the criminal?

Reimu:
I don't think I am. Probably.

Youmu:
I see. I don't feel like it's you.

Reimu:
What on earth are you on about?

Youmu:
The feasts lately have been pretty suspicious. 
There's such a thick presence everywhere, but no one even stops to wonder why. 
I thought somebody at the feast was plotting something, 
so I started investigating...

Reimu:
Really? Well, that's a coincidence. I've been doing the same thing. 
But I think I've figured out the criminal.

Youmu:
You have? 
Actually, I had someone in mind too...

Reimu:
Then we have another coincidence.

Youmu:
She's standing right in front of me.

Reimu:
It's a good thing I didn't have to track you down myself. 
I suspected "Youmu", too.

Reimu:
Now fess up! 
You're behind this, aren't you? You're the one who shrouded Gensokyo 
with strange mist and drove everyone crazy!

Youmu:
No, I didn't do itÔΩû

Reimu:
Well, whatever, maybe you're a conspirator. 
That means there's two criminals.

Youmu:
But aren't you the criminal, Reimu?

Reimu:
If I were the criminal, I'd have the feasts 
at your place, not the shrine!

?:
Hey, no trespassing!

Reimu:
I came here on purpose to do some investigating, 
wondering if "she" could be the one responsible for the strange mist.

Sakuya:
Hm. Do you have business with the mistress?

Reimu:
She seems like she'd do something like this, so I came to teach her a lesson.

Sakuya:
Don't just come here based on appearances. 
Though she does look like that.

Reimu:
So where is she then?

Sakuya:
It feels like I've said this before, but 
why would I allow the mistress to be in danger?

Sakuya:
You sure have guts coming here at night... 
But courage and stupidity are quite different.

Reimu:
Whatever, how about just get this over with? 
I already know you're not the criminal.

Sakuya:
You're speaking to me quite rudely. 
There's no need to worry. We have as much time as we need.

Reimu:
No, there's only one day left! The feast is tomorrow!

Sakuya:
Yes, there's only one day before tomorrow, 
but that's unlimited time for me.

Reimu:
You're just a broken clock. 
While we're here, the criminal is sneaking around...

Sakuya:
Hold it. 
Like I've said long before, 
Why would I allow the mistress to be in danger?

Reimu:
'Long before'? In unlimited time? 
Anyway, I think I remember that from before, too.

Sakuya:
You have! 
Back then, you suddenly arrived and forced your way in.

Reimu:
Back then, the reason was the strange mist, too... 
Wait, how did it end back then, again?

Sakuya:
Hah! It ended like this!

Reimu:
Oh yeah, I remember! 
It ended like this back then, didn't it?

Sakuya:
Oh no. I've lost again...

Reimu:
Hurry and fetch your master. You're the maid, aren't you? 
A maid only capable of serving guests.

Sakuya:
I have no choice. 
However, the mistress has done nothing this time. 
Really. Probably.

Reimu:
I can't just leave now, after coming this far.

Sakuya:
If you don't pull back a little, someone could end up getting hurt later, you know.

Reimu:
Yeah, someone's definitely getting hurt next time.

Reimu:
Hey, come out! I know you're in here.

Sakuya:
Of course she's in here.

Remilia:
What? You're so loud. 
What on earth do you want at this hour?

Reimu:
That's simple. I came to defeat you, 
and along the way I took down your bodyguard too.

Remilia:
What kind of reason is that!?

Remilia:
I really have no inkling as to why we should fight.

Reimu:
That's right. 
I have no inkling as to what you're trying to achieve by doing this, either!

Remilia:
Doing what? You just suddenly punched your way into my mansion... 
And if you get beaten instead, you'll leave? 
What does this have to do with me?

Reimu:
You're the one, right? 
You're plotting something for tomorrow's feast, right?

Remilia:
Well, I'm plotting 'something', but... 
How would you know that?

Reimu:
I thought so. There's strange mist overflowing all over the place.

Remilia:
A strange mist? 
Now that you mention it, I did notice. 
But it's not really that important, is it?

Reimu:
What's dangerous is dangerous! 
That's how it's always been.

Remilia:
Anyway, tomorrow's feast is at your shrine. 
Why don't you go back and prepare something?

Reimu:
Were you even listening?

Remilia:
If you can't figure out the source of this mist... 
All you can really do is put your effort into preparing for the feast.

Reimu:
Enough talk. 
I don't know what's going on, 
but I'm sure that if I defeat you, everything will be fine!

Remilia:
W-What?

Reimu:
Now then! I don't know what you were plotting, 
but you can forget about it.

Remilia:
What are you talking about? This mist obviously isn't mine. 
Don't you know that?

Reimu:
Wait, it's not?

Remilia:
Don't you even know what kind of power this mist has, or what it means?

Reimu:
I came here because I didn't know!

Remilia:
Don't be so arrogant about it...

Reimu:
So it's the day of the feast already... And I still don't know anything about this mist's origin or purpose. 
Maybe I should just solve the problem 
on the spot when something actually happens. 
Let's not drink the leftover sake today...

Yukari:
Heheheh. I wonder if something will happen during today's feast.

Reimu:
!?

Yukari:
Shall we begin the feast right away? 
Don't worry, nothing will happen today.

Reimu:
Oh? I think something's happening already...

Yukari:
Nevermind, I brought liquor for everyone to enjoy. 
90% alcohol, just like a right angle.

Reimu:
Wait a minute. 
Did I invite you to the feast?

Yukari:
Oh my, of course I was invitedÔΩû

Reimu:
No you weren't.

Yukari:
Everyone's being so mean to me. 
Why are you all leaving me out?

Reimu:
Basically, because we don't know where do you live. 
And because you're such a troublemaker.

Yukari:
Should I invite you to my home next time?

Reimu:
Anyway, what are you planning? 
Are you the one behind all this mist the feasting marathon?

Yukari:
My my, I don't have that much time. And I wasn't even invited anyway.

Reimu:
Too suspicious. 
You're always suspicious. 
Appears without being invited, 
and doesn't appear when invited...

Yukari:
My, have you ever invited me to anything?

Reimu:
Nope!

Yukari:
Well, I don't care. Night will soon fall. 
You were teasing me so much, so I thought I'd play around with the sky a little so we can enjoy day and night at the same time.
If night falls now, the sky will probably turn to morning.
The border of daylight and moonlight is mine. 
Do you still think you can have a night feast like this?

Reimu:
Night is... Gensokyo's!

Yukari:
You're a tad bit mistaken!

Yukari:
Ow.

Reimu:
So what's going on?

Yukari:
Uhhh. I'm not involvedÔΩû 
She's playing with everyoneÔΩû 
These feasts starting, Youmu getting drunk and starting to dance... It's all because of her.

Reimu:
Who is "she"?

Yukari:
I have no choice. 
Look, I'll let you see her.

Suika:
Huh? What's up, Yukari? 
Oh, and who's she?

Reimu:
Oh, and who are you?

Suika:
I was just trying to have a little fun.

Suika:
But hey, why can you see me?

Reimu:
You're the one behind this whole mess? 
Why did you do all this?

Suika:
"All this"? Oh, you actually know what's happening. 
And here I thought you were just randomly wreaking havoc on random places.

Reimu:
You know we've been having more feasts lately. 
And then this strange mist appears... 
Er, wait, you know what I've been doing, so...!

Suika:
Wait, wait, are you blaming me for the number of feasts?

Reimu:
...Er, that's what Yukari said.

Suika:
Well, it's true.

Reimu:
Well didn't I just say that!?

Suika:
Don't you mean "what Yukari said"? 
Isn't it way more lively to have feasts this often? 
I love this lively atmosphere. 
I wonder how to make things more lively.

Reimu:
I don't remember someone like you at the feast.

Suika:
What are you talking about? I was there the whole time. 
The winter was longer than normal this year, wasn't it? 
I love flower viewings, but it kept getting delayed... 
And then when spring finally came, all the cherry blossoms bloomed and fell right away... 
It's the worst year ever!

Reimu:
But still, where were you during the feast? 
I didn't see anyone like you there!

Suika:
Huh? But I was at the feast the whole time. 
Well, I was spread out as a mist the whole time, so I guess only the sensitive ones noticed. 
It was really fun. 
There were youkai, witches, vampires, and phantoms. Just like the night parade of a hundred demons.

Reimu:
Ah, I see. 
The mist itself was the criminal. That's why I didn't get it. That's a relief.

Suika:
A relief?

Reimu:
It means my sixth sense hasn't gotten dull. 
Which means my "must defeat you" feeling is probably correct.

Suika:
I've been watching all of you this whole time. 
You all responded to my "foregathering ability" without noticing, and came to these feasts. 
Do you know what this means? 
It means none of you can defeat me.

Reimu:
But you're just a youkai, aren't you? 
It's my job to defeat youkai. 
Defeating you is just a matter of course.

Suika:
Ohhh. Hahahahahaha! 
The moment you thought of me as a youkai, you had already lost.

Reimu:
!?

Suika:
My army is the night parade of a hundred demons! 
No human or youkai can stand against foregathered oni!

Marisa:
Guess I'll start by wasting whatever's around. 
I doubt she's involved, though.

Alice:
What is it? What are you up to?

Marisa:
Eh? 
Just thought I'd waste whatever's around here first.

Alice:
What a coincidence. I just wasted some useless dolls.
But listen. If you're trying to waste time, try that scarlet place. 
But if you have time to waste, you may find fortune at that red-white's place.

Marisa:
Where is a good place to waste you?

Alice:
Hmm. Maybe somewhere bright?

Marisa:
Sorry, but I don't trust your doll-wasting fortunes.

Alice:
That's not surprising. I've never told a fortune before in the first place.

Marisa:
It's pretty dark here, but whatever. I'll take you down.

Alice:
On that note, it's very unlucky to waste someone in a dark place.

Marisa:
I'm just wasting time, aren't I?

Alice:
You want to investigate the mysterious feasts, right?
I'm not involved with that. 
There are far more suspicious places than this.

Marisa:
Eep. I only came here to waste time, and a bad kid, too.

Marisa:
'If you have time to waste, you may find fortune at that red-white's place,' huh?
Even though I'm pretty much lucky all the time anyway. 
And I don't see any enemies around.
Maybe I'll just waste a little time here.

Sakuya:
Oh, I spy something black and inconspicuous.

Marisa:
Oh? Well, I am pretty modest.

Sakuya:
What do you need from the shrine? 
If you're looking for Reimu, she's not here.

Marisa:
Since when are you the shrine's maid?

Sakuya:
I do not change my allegiance.

Marisa:
Well, I guess a shrine maiden is kind of like a god's maid.

Sakuya:
Indeed. But it looks like she's slacking off right now. 
So if you have nothing to do, you should go home.

Marisa:
Someone at an empty shrine at night... 
Wait, you're really suspicious.

Sakuya:
Dear me, you don't seem so modest after all.

Marisa:
She wasn't it either. What're you here for, anyway?

Sakuya:
I just thought I'd come to where we've been having 
feasts. I was hoping to find some clues.
Unfortunately, there's no sign of the criminal...

Marisa:
I don't really think Reimu'd do somethin' like this. 
She wouldn't be so roundabout.

Sakuya:
Gee, this ended up being a huge waste of time.

Marisa:
I see. I guess I did waste some time after all, 
just like Alice said.

Marisa:
Heh, I could never just come in the front door anyway.
I'd much rather sneak in from the back, like-

???:
Hey.

Patchouli:
Stop sneaking in here. This is my room.

Marisa:
You know, reading books in a dark place is gonna make you're eyes go bad.

Patchouli:
Make my eyes bad? You mean, not being able to see things at a distance? 
That's not my eyes getting worse.
That's just my eyes adapting to the fact 
that there is no longer a need to see distant things.
Didn't you learn that at school?

Marisa:
Okay, then it's actually the opposite. Your books will go bad.

Patchouli:
What does that mean?

Marisa:
Well, it's a natural phenomenon, y'see.

Patchouli:
What are you doing here, anyway?

Marisa:
Er, well, haven't you noticed all this? 
There's this weird feeling all over the place outside.

Patchouli:
Oh, that? No, that's harmless. 
...And it's not a "feeling", either.

Marisa:
What's that mean? You're pretty suspicious.

Patchouli:
It is a natural phenomenon +1. Please educate yourself on 
simple things like this if you want to call yourself a magician.

Patchouli:
Mukyuu„Éº

Marisa:
Answer me! What the heck is that strange feeling 
saturating the world outside?

Patchouli:
I'm going to go lay down...

Marisa:
Wow, she really is useless. Why do they raise people like this 
here?

Marisa:
...Seems it's finally gotten serious.
Would you come out already, you devil master?

Remilia:
Geez, how in the world did you get in?

Marisa:
I came in the front door. Y'know, normally.

Remilia:
Since when did the entrance of my mansion became so free-to-enter?

Marisa:
Probably ever since you got famous for doing bad 
stuff.

Remilia:
Ah, well, I don't do anything good, certainly.

Marisa:
So I volunteered for some devil extermination. 
Since I used to be a vampire hunter.

Remilia:
That's news to me.

Marisa:
Now just hold still, and I'll make this quick and easy.

Remilia:
Mind if I ask why you're here?

Marisa:
Well, it's because of the incident this time. I assumed 
it was you doing something evil again.

Remilia:
Well, I don't think I am.

Marisa:
Whatever. I'll get the truth out of you by force.

Marisa:
Huh? Nothing changed. Was I wrong?

Remilia:
I was being honest from the beginning, geez.

Marisa:
This ain't good. Tomorrow's the feast, y'know? 
Is the strange presence gonna stick around for this one too?

Remilia:
If you're wondering about the strange presence, it's centering around the shrine. 
Didn't you notice that?

Marisa:
Is that so? 
Man, I guess I gotta go take on the shrine after all.

Reimu:
Oh, hello, Marisa. You're pretty early. There's still half a day left.

Marisa:
I'm always early.

Reimu:
Well, you're only ever early for feasts and whatnot.

Marisa:
I'm the always the first to arrive.

Reimu:
What are you talking about? I'm the first to arrive.

Marisa:
Aren't you the zero-th? 
The feast is at your shrine, so...

Reimu:
Well, whatever. I need to clean the shrine, so 
have some tea or something.
We still have a lot of time left.

Marisa:
Hey, don't you notice anything?

Reimu:
Like what?

Marisa:
Huh? About this strange energy. 
It's all flowing right from here, isn't it?

Reimu:
Hmm, do you think so? Isn't it just a leftover energy from the last feast?

Marisa:
Damn, that's suspicious. 
Aren't you usually all up at arms for things like this!?

Reimu:
This is no big deal! 
I'm not sensing much danger from it anyway.

Marisa:
Maybe you're numbed to it from being here all this time. 
It's like when you notice how other peoples' houses smell, but not yours.

Reimu:
Geez, this is unlike you, Marisa. Just stay there 
and have some tea or something.

Marisa:
Or... could you be the one? 
Nah, that couldn't be, could it?

Reimu:
What the heck are you thinking?

Marisa:
That's weird. I didn't think it was Reimu, but...

Reimu:
I don't put out weird energy! In the first place, 
I already laid traps here!

Marisa:
Oh, you did?
Well never mind. I'll exterminate the evil boss for 
you. Do you have any idea who it is?

Reimu:
Not a clue.

Marisa:
The sun'll set soon.
If a youkai is gonna appear, it'll be more likely starting now.

???:
Oh my, what an unusually tense mood.

Marisa:
One came.

Yukari:
Isn't there a feast today? It feels like you're 
ready for a battle or something.

Marisa:
I am ready for one! This is a battlefield. A battle-shrine.

Yukari:
Are you after some of this alcohol I brought? 
It is expensive liquor, after all.

Marisa:
I don't get it. You've never brought any sake before... 
Wait, were you even at the feasts?

Yukari:
Well nobody wanted to invite me. 
I heard from Ran and came on my own.

Marisa:
What are you plotting?

Yukari:
I heard the vampire will bring some good brandy 
with her.
That's what I'm here for.

Marisa:
Argh, that's so suspicious!

Yukari:
How rude! I only know one other human that's as 
rude as you.

Marisa:
I don't think I'm as rude as that one.
But in any case, your plotting ends now. 
That's for sure.

Yukari:
My, are you after her brandy, too? 
That makes us rivals.

Marisa:
No, I'm after the Ginjoushu. you brought!

Yukari:
Wow, you don't need to hurry. There's plenty 
of booze to go round.

Marisa:
Why don't you reveal yourself already?
The feasts, and this strange energy... It's all part of your plan, ain't it?

Yukari:
The strange energy is produced by density.
It is gathering all sorts of humans, devils, and phantoms. 
It's got nothing to do with me.

Marisa:
So this strange energy ain't yours?

Yukari:
The energy itself is "her". ...Well, her density is too low 
for humans to see her right now, though.

Marisa:
It's so thin I can see clearly for miles. 
Y'know, I heard human eyes never go bad.

Yukari:
There. Now you can see her, right?

Suika:
Huh? What's up? Isn't it about time for the feast?

Marisa:
Sorry, the feast is canceled.

Suika:
Oh no! I prepared so much for it, tooÔΩû

Marisa:
My fortune today said I should avoid 
danger before it happens.

Suika:
Well, I guess it would be fortunate to keep a disaster from happening.

Marisa:
The disaster hasn't happened yet, right? 
...Since you're it.

Suika:
How rude. 
Can you imagine how much I expected from the feast?

Marisa:
I don't recall inviting something like you. 
I'm the secretary, after all, so I'm sure about that.

Suika:
I was the one who made you the secretary.
I'm the one who manipulated others to assemble for no reason at all, 
no matter what they were thinking.
I gathered you so that you would gather others.

Marisa:
Oh, is that it? I dunno how you made us want to gather here, 
but what's your goal?

Suika:
I told you already. The feast is the goal!

Marisa:
What? I don't get it.

Suika:
This year's spring was too short!
There weren't enough flower viewings.
I like it way better when things are way more lively.
So we should continue the feasts, 
since I like it when things are way more lively.

Marisa:
Well, it's not my fault that spring was short. 
It's because of the ghost, the spring wind, and some natural phenomenon.

Suika:
It doesn't matter. 
But we should be a little more lively.

Marisa:
Okay then. We have to decrease the number of feasts though.
There's just way too many. Even Reimu is getting 
tired out from it.

Suika:
Huh? But I was gonna bring some friends 
in a little whileÔΩû

Marisa:
Looks like I have to take you down before that, then.

Suika:
My ideal is to make every night the parade of a hundred demons.
Gensokyo's night belongs to us, the oni. 
It'll be lively and wonderful!

Marisa:
There's no oni in Gensokyo. 
Wasn't that what they promised!?

Suika:
If you think oni don't exist, then I'll show you one. 
I'll show you the feast of the forgathering oni!

Sakuya:
Anyone here?

Reimu:
Oh, are you alone? How unusual. 
What do you want?

Sakuya:
Well, I thought I should pray here.

Reimu:
Uh, is that so? Is this your unlucky year or something?

Sakuya:
Never. You know my age, don't you?

Reimu:
Okay, you need some exorcism or something, don't you? 
By the way, the offertory box is over there.

Sakuya:
Anyway, on the other hand, I just wanted to 
investigate something for the day after tomorrow's feast.

Reimu:
Ahh, never mind the amount. A one-yen bill would be enough, 
and what's wrong about the feast?

Sakuya:
Something's not right about the current atmosphere.
You too have realized it, haven't you? 
The air is filled with strange energy.

Reimu:
Because you're gathering it every night, 
maybe you've created left-over energy.

Sakuya:
Every night? It's a three-day period. 
And I feel it getting stronger as the feast gets nearer....

Reimu:
Maybe it's just your imagination. By the way, the offertory box is over there.

Sakuya:
Wait, you're very suspicious.

Sakuya:
Uhh, on second thought, it's not the energy of a shrine maiden.

Reimu:
Hey- what's this all about?

Sakuya:
Anyway, I will deal with this strange energy before the feast day.

Reimu:
Do whatever you like. I'm very busy preparing and cleaning for the feast.
And, the wonderful offertory box is over there.

Sakuya:
Too bad. I don't believe in god.

Sakuya:
I just realized I've entered this forest only a few times.
I'm quite sure.... that she lived in this 
not-so-clean and humid place.

Alice:
Huh? What an unusual face here.

Sakuya:
"Unusual face"? How rude.

Alice:
So, what do you want?

Sakuya:
I knew it was a mistake to come here at night.

Alice:
Entering this forest at night, 
only the 'greater fools' would do it.

Sakuya:
My destination was the black-clothed girl's home. 
But I arrived at the wrong place.

Alice:
....you're a greater fool.

Sakuya:
Oh, whatever. There is still one day left. 
Can you tell me the way out of here?

Alice:
Think you can harmlessly return after 
a mistaken visit?

Sakuya:
I thought so.

Sakuya:
So, it's late for today.... I'll return home.

Alice:
You don't know the way back, do you? 
You want me to escort you to the exit, don't you?

Sakuya:
My, you're so kind, I didn't even ask you yet.

Alice:
A "greater fool" may attempt to fly to return home 
from this forest of magic.

Sakuya:
Ahhhhh.

Sakuya:
Okay, I'm going the right way today.
Certainly day travel is better, even through this dark forest.

Marisa:
Huh? What an unusual face here.

Sakuya:
Uh, yeah, I was an unusual face yesterday, too.

Marisa:
So, what do you want, Miss Unusual Face? A request for work?

Sakuya:
You were disowned a long time ago, weren't you?

Marisa:
Ahhh-? I didn't give up my business yet.

Sakuya:
Well, but, no customers come here. 
After all, they will lose their way.

Marisa:
But you didn't get lost and came here. 
Are you saying you're special?

Sakuya:
I am special. It's ridiculous for me to get lost.

Marisa:
So? What do you want, Miss Unusual Face With "Anti-Lost"?

Sakuya:
Ah yes, about tomorrow's feast.....

Marisa:
Yeah, don't worry. You won't be killed, anyway.

Sakuya:
I didn't say anything yet...... by any chance.

Marisa:
Ahhh, are you sure?

Sakuya:
Uhh, enough joking around.

Marisa:
So what's wrong with tomorrow's feast?

Sakuya:
I just wanted to consult with you about it, but you 
keep on talking nonsense!
Maybe it was a mistake to consult Marisa, from the beginning.

Marisa:
How ruthless. Do you think of me as a consultant or something? 
If you want to consult something, try other people.

Sakuya:
That's quite an unexpected reaction. 
Whatever, I determined Marisa is not involved.

Sakuya:
The only remaining suspects are here, I think.
These girls took our spring for a mere flower viewing, 
Anything could happen here.

Youmu:
Came to the netherworld alive, again.... 
Do you really crave to die?

Sakuya:
As if it's okay for the dead to come to the living world. 
Why aren't humans allowed to come to the netherworld alive?

Youmu:
There are upper-compatibility problems. Between human and phantoms.

Sakuya:
But, upper-compatibility or whatever, being dangerous is not allowed for anyone.
Even for phantoms, if they plan to harm humans...

Youmu:
Humans will kill them? But they're phantoms, you know? 
Phantoms are free, always.

Sakuya:
Hah! Why don't you ascend to heaven or somewhere?

Youmu:
Ascending to heaven is currently forbidden. 
Heaven is saturated now.

Sakuya:
What troublesome living things phantoms are. 
Oh wait, they're not "living". Maybe just things?

Youmu:
Phantoms are the most wonderful dying form. 
You don't understand that.

Sakuya:
I think you cannot ascend to heaven since you died incorrectly.
Humans are.... smart. If they die with regret, 
They can live freely without ascending to heaven.... alive?

Youmu:
Enough of this idle talk, 
You too want to add a red stain to my Roukan-Blade?

Sakuya:
"You too", huh? Sounds like you just sliced someone.

Youmu:
Uhh, well... 
Phantoms don't make stains, even sliced.

Sakuya:
My, you weren't doing it, were you?

Youmu:
Doing what? Is this about the strange energy? That wasn't me. 
Hey, let's fight AFTER stating the reasons...

Sakuya:
Those planning something bad will tell lies anyway.

Youmu:
Well, maybe that's true.

Sakuya:
So, next is your boss.

Yuyuko:
What's this noise at this time of night? I'm so sleepy.

Sakuya:
What a regular life, for a phantom.

Yuyuko:
I'm a ghost, not a phantom. But wait, it's 2 a.m. 
I fear something haunts...

Sakuya:
Nonsense! Hey, you're a ghost!

Yuyuko:
But I do fear being haunted. Like, by monsters or something.

Sakuya:
This time.... maybe I should state my purpose first.

Yuyuko:
?

Sakuya:
You know, there's a feast tomorrow at the shrine. 
I think you were invited, too.
But it's quite strange. 
The feasts are too frequent, and nobody's curious about that.
Further, strange energies are becoming more thick day by day.

Yuyuko:
So? What's the point?

Sakuya:
It's your doing, isn't it?

Yuyuko:
No, that's not true.

Sakuya:
As I thought, what a waste of time.

Yuyuko:
It's strange to ask like that. And.....
Anyone will tell lies, if they are planning something bad.

Sakuya:
I see, it's definitely you. I thought so from the beginning.

Yuyuko:
I'm not telling lies~

Sakuya:
Looks like you're surely not. Ugh, what a waste of time. 
I have infinite time, anyway.

Yuyuko:
"Ugh"? Whatever, I'm going to sleep now.

Sakuya:
Strange. There are no more suspects left now...

Yuyuko:
Good night~.

Sakuya:
The only remaining suspect is, maybe that girl?

Sakuya:
How troublesome...

Reimu:
What's the matter?

Sakuya:
I don't know where Yukari lives...

Reimu:
Er, I don't know either.

???:
I hear the voices calling~

Sakuya:
No one can escape my knives.

Yukari:
Oh no. She will shoot me down~

Sakuya:
You appeared with perfect timing. 
Like you eavesdropped.

Yukari:
Uh yeah, I did eavesdrop.

Yukari:
Anyway, isn't it almost the time? To begin the great dream feast.

Sakuya:
Congratulations, as it's become clear that you're the main cause of these strange incidents. As of now.
You're always planning something bad, aren't you? Every day and night.

Yukari:
How cruel. I brought my liquour with me. 
I don't plan to attend the feast free of charge.

Sakuya:
Anyone who plans something bad will tell lies.

Yukari:
Look, the Ginjoushu. of fantasy.
It's so fantastic as its bottle floats in the sky.

Sakuya:
Listen, no one asked you about liquors!

Yukari:
Uhh-.
By the way... what's these 'strange incidents'?

Sakuya:
I will never answer the questions of the suspect. 
They will surely tell lies. You're the liar!

Yukari:
I'm not telling lies~. 
Look, can't you see it's floating in the air? The Ginjoushu. of fantasy.

Sakuya:
And anyway, you've come to the feast without any invitation.

Yukari:
Oh my, is THAT the 'strange incident'? Maybe I'm a mobile strange incident.

Sakuya:
Whatever, stop the bad things and lies, now.

Yukari:
(What bad things and lies is she referring to? I did too many to remember, anyway....)

Sakuya:
So, I will not let you tell lies now.
What was the purpose of it? Surrounding Gensokyo with this strange energy....

Yukari:
I don't know well, but it's not me~. 
I don't plan such strange things~.

Sakuya:
Look, the strange energies are getting stronger even now....

Yukari:
Energy? Ahhh, I got it. Didn't you notice?

Sakuya:
I noticed it, 
so I'm pressing you for the answer...

Yukari:
No no, not about that....
Look, it's the tiniest night parade of a hundred demons in this world.

Suika:
Err, what's up, Yukari? The feast will begin soon, 
Why did you pull me up?

Sakuya:
Huh!? Who is she? She came out of nowhere!

Suika:
Oh my, I was here from the beginning, maybe earlier. Didn't you notice? Miss Maid Of The Devil?

Sakuya:
The thick, dense strange energies have disappeared... 
So you're the boss of the feast.

Suika:
Hey wait, "boss of the feast"? 
And it's not "strange energies"....

Sakuya:
(Anyone who plans something bad will tell lies)

Suika:
The mist itself is, me.

Sakuya:
Oooh.

Suika:
I dispersed my body to embrace all of Gensokyo, 
to forgather everyone to the feast.

Sakuya:
Is that so?

Suika:
Feasts are fun.
They're just like the night parade of a hundred demons.
So I thought, I would use my powers to forgather more and 
more humans and youkai and phantoms to hold greater feasts...

Sakuya:
Oooh, that's wonderful.

Suika:
Hey, are you listening to me?

Sakuya:
By the way, it's already time for the feast. 
Everyone's gathered now.

Suika:
Tonight's the parade of a hundred demons again. 
Near-invisibly thinned oni will surround Gensokyo now.

Sakuya:
Whatever, I should defeat her for this.
And listen, drawing out oni...?
That's too unrealistic even for a lie. 
What a childish lie.

Suika:
But...you didn't even notice my appearance, did you?
Whether I was lying or not.... you'll know the answer after 
seeing my forgathering power and greeting a cheerful death!

Alice:
What a waste of time.
Shouldn't humans be the ones worrying about "youkai incidents" like this?

Marisa:
Oh, it's a youkai. What's up?

Alice:
It's strange to be the one saying this, but ... 
You ... two are too lazy these days.
Why don't you do something about this case?

Marisa:
Huh? What do you mean, "case"?

Alice:
What are you talking about? Isn't it obvious?

Marisa:
Well, it's pretty hot lately, but it's summer, so that's normal.

Alice:
I'm not talking about the heat! I mean this strange mist, and all these festivals.

Marisa:
Mist? Festivals? Yeah, we've had a lot of both lately. 
But it is hot, and it is summer.

Alice:
Well, you've got guts. If you won't take care of it, 
I'll take care of you.

Alice:
Phew, so?
Don't you know anything about this mist?

Marisa:
If I did, I'd have taken care of it already.

Alice:
I suppose. Looks like I have no choice. 
I should go visit that other person that might know something.

Marisa:
Her?
I think she'd take care of it, too, if she knew anything.

Alice:
Or maybe she's the one behind all of this.

Alice:
Reimu ought to know something.
She is a shrine maiden, so it's her job to at least 
try to manage youkai.

Reimu:
Hmm? What could you want at this hour? 
If it's food, I already had dinner.

Alice:
Who do you think I am, a beggar?

Reimu:
People who live in the forest and sneak into the shrine 
during the night usually are.

Alice:
Enough of that, Reimu.
About this strange mist that's all over Gensokyo ...

Reimu:
Mm? The mist?

Alice:
I've been wondering why it appeared ...

Reimu:
The mist ...¬†? Is there something dangerous about it?

Alice:
Well, I was wondering why you're usually so concerned whenever 
something happens, but you're not doing anything this time ...

Reimu:
Because nothing bad has been happening.
Well, it's a pain that there are so many feasts ...

Alice:
It's suspicious. And it's strange to see you 
acting so suspiciously.

Alice:
So? Do you really have no information at all?

Reimu:
Yes. And I sense no danger in this.

Alice:
Ummmm. I don't really do much youkai hunting, so I have 
no idea what the source of this mist is.

Reimu:
Youkai hunting ... well, that's because 
you're not human.
Hmm, where does this mist come from?
Even I have no idea. I wonder why?

Alice:
Hm, not much left if you take away your intuition, eh?
Really, your sixth sense will dull if you goof off and never use it.

Sakuya:
Well, you got in trouble, so you came to see me?

Alice:
There's not much left to investigate. 
I don't expect you know much of interest, though.

Sakuya:
I can't really worry about that right now. All the feasts 
lately have left the mistress quite stressed.

Alice:
I wonder if the mistress is doing something bad.

Sakuya:
But I don't think so. Really. Surely.

Alice:
Right, I'm sure she probably isn't. 
(I really don't want to run into her, so ... )

Sakuya:
Well, there is somebody with extensive knowledge here.

Alice:
Is that so? Then, I should visit her.

Sakuya:
But, I won't let you pass, of course.

Alice:
Then, what was the point of mentioning it?

Sakuya:
Well ...

Sakuya:
If I don't take a little break, my stress levels 
will get out of control as well.

Alice:
How can a maid say that?
Though I don't believe this is going to be terribly restful.

Alice:
So, why don't you take me to this person with 
extensive knowledge now?

Sakuya:
Hm, I suppose I have no choice.

Alice:
But, if this person knows something about this incident, 
Why do they do nothing?

Sakuya:
She's always been like that. She never makes a move 
unless it's something truly serious.

Alice:
An armchair detective. 
How clever.

Patchouli:
The source of the mist enveloping Gensokyo?

Alice:
Yes, I heard you might know who's doing this.

Patchouli:
I haven't thought much about it.
But, isn't it obvious?

Alice:
Can you tell me?

Patchouli:
It's not really a ghostly mist. 
And it doesn't really have a source, per se.

Alice:
What do you mean?

Patchouli:
To put it another way, don't you think the mist-like thing 
itself is the source?

Alice:
I don't really understand ... so?

Patchouli:
Your question is too vague to answer. 
What I've said is all there is to it.

Alice:
I don't understand. Why does everyone in Gensokyo 
insist on speaking in riddles?

Patchouli:
Well, a direct battle is straightforward, isn't it?

Alice:
Quite a reply, huh. 
Why don't I teach you how to be more talkative?

Alice:
So? What should I do about this mist?

Patchouli:
It's not a mist, and it doesn't appear to be dangerous. 
Why not leave it alone?

Alice:
Is that all? 
I can't just give up after coming so far.

Patchouli:
I suppose. In that case ... Why don't you try having 
a nice, straightforward discussion with it?

Alice:
... That sounds difficult.

Youmu:
So, you want to be able to speak with a phantom?

Alice:
Sure. "What doesn't have substance, but has intent..."
The answer is a phantom, I guess.

Youmu:
A phantom, you say ...
Well, how to communicate with it depends on what it 
was in life and what kind of life it lived.
So, what kind of phantom do you want to talk to?

Alice:
Yes ... well, it's ...
A phantom so big it could envelope all of Gensokyo.

Youmu:
Huh? Are you trying to make fun of phantoms?

Alice:
I'm completely serious. What don't you understand?

Youmu:
It would have to be that big in life to be that 
big as a phantom.
Wouldn't that make it the phantom of a city or a country?

Alice:
Maybe!
... so, have any big countries died recently?

Youmu:
Come on, I wasn't being serious.
You couldn't talk to something like that. 
It would be a god, not a spirit.

Alice:
Why don't you just show me how to see what a phantom wants?

Youmu:
Okay, but isn't a feast about to start somewhere?

Alice:
If you teach me before then, I could use it as a party trick.

Alice:
It's easy to tell phantoms apart.
A -14.7‚ÑÉ phantom is left over from the regret of 
having died while borrowing money.

Youmu:
So what about a really big phantom?

Alice:
Yes ... well, I'm starting to think that maybe 
this isn't actually a phantom, after all.

Youmu:
Of course not. A phantom big enough to surround all of Gensokyo 
would have to be the spirit of Gensokyo.

Alice:
I guess I'll just have to wait at the meeting place for the feast.

Reimu:
So what happened with that mist you were worried about?

Alice:
It appears to be ... not mist. I don't really understand it ...

Reimu:
So you decided to come back here.

Alice:
The real battle begins now.

???:
What's with the serious face at a feast?

Yukari:
This is going to be another exciting feast, right?

Alice:
It makes you look like a bad guy if you're always 
showing up without being invited.

Yukari:
The not-inviting just has a bad attitude.

Alice:
Is this revenge?

Yukari:
Revenge? I haven't done anything wrong. Yet.

Alice:
Yet? Well, aside from this mist-like stuff being everywhere, 
Nothing has really happened yet ...

Yukari:
Mist-like stuff?

Alice:
Yes, this mist-like thing enveloping Gensokyo.

Yukari:
Oh, I don't have anything to do with that. 
That's her doing, isn't it?

Alice:
"Her"? But there's no-one there.

Yukari:
There's a troubled child, but she has no ill intentions. 
Though, she is a troubled child.

Alice:
Okay, so where is she?

Yukari:
Oh, can't you see her? She's right in front of you.

Alice:
Well, there is a troubled soul in front of me ...

Yukari:
Yes! It's her!

Alice:
What's with that funny look on your face?

Yukari:
It was there from the start. 
Geez, can't you see this has nothing to do with me?

Alice:
Very well, then what is this mist-like thing?

Yukari:
Yeeees ... what do you think happens if you spread a 
drop of blood on a lake?

Alice:
... the fish will gather around it?

Yukari:
Right, but wrong. There are no fish in this lake.
Well, let's restore the drop of blood to its original form.

Suika:
Wh, what? 
What are you doing, Yukari? The feast was just about to start.

Alice:
What? What is this ...

Suika:
Oh, hi~

Suika:
I've been watching you for a while now ... 
It was a lot of fun!
Your investigation was a little misdirected ... 
You kept avoiding the really strong youkai ...

Alice:
Where were you watching from, you little voyeur?

Suika:
Don't you get it yet?
I'm a really big phantom, big enough to surround Gensokyo.

Alice:
Hmm, actually, hasn't the mist disappeared?

Suika:
There was no mist to begin with. 
I just spread out thin to look around. It feels really nice.

Alice:
... you mean you can do that? 
That's impressive.

Suika:
I'm different from you magicians, you know?

Alice:
Oh, really? You don't look it.
In any case, what are you after?

Suika:
Oh, I already got it a long time ago.

Alice:
What's that? 
I suppose it couldn't have been that important, then.

Suika:
You've all been feasting up a storm, haven't you? 
Well, I did want to get a lot more people together.
Nobody was able to resist my attractive force.
Well, except maybe Yukari? 
I couldn't attract her with my power.

Alice:
Oh? Why don't I try resisting you now, then?

Suika:
Hmph.
You've fallen into my trap just by being here.
You've never even noticed that you became part of my 
night parade of a hundred demons of your own accord.

Alice:
Hundr- ... how rude, 
Counting people as monsters.

Suika:
Well, maybe you're a ghost?
After all, a magic user like you -
Must be greener than the grass to try to 
defy us, the proud race of oni!

Patchouli:
...
...It appears a rat has snuck its way in again.
I'm sure the rat poison was... behind the bookshelves.

Marisa:
Hold it, humans don't need rat poison.

Patchouli:
So the black rat decides to expose itself. 
No need for the rat poison, then.

Marisa:
You've got it wrong, I'm not sneaking around today. 
I came here to look up a little something.

Patchouli:
You snuck in, that's sneaking around.

Marisa:
Not exactly. Stealthy investigation.

Patchouli:
I do wish for a cat after all.

Marisa:
A cat?

Patchouli:
Rats that discreetly scamper their way in--, 
I'd like a cat that would exterminate them for me.

Patchouli:
Now then, it's time for me to give this abnormality 
a splendid investigation. Rats should return to their nest.

Marisa:
Gah, I wanted to deal with this case.

Patchouli:
I'm already investigating.

Marisa:
Damn, you plan on settling it yourself, huh.

Patchouli:
Rats have no power to resolve this abnormality. 
It's hopeless for the likes of you.

Sakuya:
What's the matter? Suddenly calling for me.

Patchouli:
Tomorrow, I have grand noble plans and will be heading out.
Therefore, I thought I should ask you to remain here and watch over the mansion.

Sakuya:
My, how rare.

Sakuya:
Very well, I shall stay behind and watch the house.

Patchouli:
About that, however...

Sakuya:
Is there something else?

Patchouli:
Lately, the number of rats have been increasing. 
Could I ask you to keep an eye out for them?

Sakuya:
Rats? Is your special rat poison no good?

Patchouli:
Not very.

Sakuya:
Then you require a more lethal poison.

Patchouli:
What I require is disciplining you into a catlike mindset.

Patchouli:
Your catness is approximately 24 points.

Sakuya:
You're rather strict.

Patchouli:
By the way, 100 points does not mean full points, but 96 points does.
Since 96 is the maximum number below 100 that can be divided in half
twice or even thrice, it is convenient. Arguments won't occur over it.

Sakuya:
Well, it doesn't change the fact that the evaluation process is strict.

Patchouli:
A difference of four is very large.
But the rough-minded you isn't likely to understand.

Patchouli:
Now then, it's about time I departed.
However, someone who has lived longer than Remi... 
There aren't much leads.

Alice:
It looks like you're heading out... wait a second!

Alice:
I want to ask you something.

Patchouli:
...Rat poison, rat poison.

Alice:
I'm sure you know. 
There's a strange energy covering Gensokyo...

Patchouli:
Our cat's a sieve. 
She lets in mice right after being told.

Alice:
Are you listening?

Patchouli:
Strange energy? You mean that mist-like thing?
That isn't energy or anything at all.
Just a fool that's nothing but huge.

Alice:
What's with your attitude? 
And I even politely asked, too.

Patchouli:
The ones who sneak in are essentially mistaken.
People with bad manners have no sense of politeness, much less anything else.

Alice:
It's a great power I've never felt before! 
I have no other choice but to investigate here.

Patchouli:
I was just about to head out.
There are only two days left until the next banquet.
There's no time to search through books!

Patchouli:
Once again I have spent worthless time.

Alice:
You're telling me nothing after all.

Patchouli:
Hurry home. 
A silver rat poison will soon bar this area.

Alice:
Fine... I'll head home.

Patchouli:
Our rat poison is half-witted, 
so this place is full of troubling rats.

Youmu:
...An unusual face to see in the underworld. 
Well, you look dead anyway.

Patchouli:
I have no business with you. I have business with your boss.

Youmu:
Eh? With Yuyuko-sama?
Well, whatever it is, I can't let you pass.

Patchouli:
Why is that?

Youmu:
Because I'm also standing guard. 
I can't simply allow suspicious people to pass through.

Patchouli:
Ah, I see. The job of guarding is--
Given to incompetent people, and only a position in name, 
from personal experience.

Youmu:
Well, I can bring you down the easy way, or--
We can do it the hard way.

Patchouli:
The undead are weak against fire.

Youmu:
The same doesn't go for phantoms!

Patchouli:
You're right. Rather, it appears that the human side is weaker to flames.

Youmu:
Compared to phantoms, humans aren't so durable.

Patchouli:
At any rate... it's gotten rather late.

Youmu:
Ah, by the way,
I think Yuyuko-sama is sleeping.

Patchouli:
Eh? Despite being a ghost she sleeps early?

Yuyuko:
Geez, what is it at this hour?

Patchouli:
I apologize for intruding while you're sleeping, 
but I'll have you come join me for a moment.

Yuyuko:
Good night.

Patchouli:
Recently, someone has been manipulating the whole 
of Gensokyo with an unknown power.
A power of an extremely ancient and native one...
No matter how much I investigated, I could find nothing
matching the power in my books. It should be in any magic book at all, but...

Yuyuko:
And? What?

Patchouli:
And you were the only one that seemed to have an inkling on this matter.

Yuyuko:
How rude. I'm still very young.

Patchouli:
Fine, just help me manage this abnormality.

Yuyuko:
Leave it alone. Nothing will happen, anyway.

Patchouli:
So you know something after all?

Yuyuko:
Ah, well, I'm not sure but it's a very nostalgic power.
Like how the power is dividing now.

Patchouli:
You know what it is.

Yuyuko:
I'm saying I don't.

Patchouli:
...The undead are weak against fire.

Yuyuko:
My, what should I do.

Patchouli:
So, give up?

Yuyuko:
I'm telling you I don't know.

Patchouli:
You don't know when to give up.

Yuyuko:
Ah, but, my friend should know when it comes to things like this.

Patchouli:
Where is this friend?

Yuyuko:
Who knows... Good night.

Patchouli:
I never found out where she was.

Reimu:
Yuyuko's friend? You mean Yukari? 
She's always around when I don't want her to be.

Patchouli:
Well, it can't be helped. It appears that I will have to
do investigation alone in regards to this abnormality.

Reimu:
Abnormality?

???:
My, I didn't think there'd ever be a time when you'd want me around.

Yukari:
Were you the one calling for me?

Patchouli:
Eh? Oh, you lived at the shrine.

Yukari:
Lived.

Patchouli:
I see. By the way, what is this recent abnormality?
You should know, correct? 
I heard you were the oldest.

Yukari:
Old? That's mean. Who said that?

Patchouli:
Answer the question.

Yukari:
Of course I know.
It's actually my troubled acquaintance. 
The one behind the banquets.

Patchouli:
Banquets? I see... And the objective behind this?

Yukari:
Ask her yourself.

Patchouli:
Where is she?

Yukari:
Sheesh, you're full of questions. Your business with me is this?

Patchouli:
It's this.

Yukari:
How boring.
If you want to meet her so much, 
I'm not going to let you.

Patchouli:
A truly troubled person.

Patchouli:
You're going to allow me to see her, right?

Yukari:
Can't be helped, then.
She's not a very interesting one, though.

Patchouli:
It's not as if I want her to be.

Yukari:
Here, she's gathering...

Patchouli:
I finally... found you.

Suika:
Huh? Time's up already?

Suika:
I thought I could've played lots and lots more too.

Patchouli:
Play? Who are you, anyway? 
What exactly did you do?

Suika:
Hm? I just made Gensokyo a bit more lively.
See, I just tweaked a little something--
Without a single complaint from anyone, they all meet at the banquet.
I just watched that and enjoyed myself.

Patchouli:
!? Those horns, you're a...

Suika:
I'm not a deer.

Patchouli:
I see, so that's why.
I now understand why I couldn't find anything in my books.
A book with that information wouldn't be anywhere in my... 
anywhere in Gensokyo.

Suika:
I'm not a goat either~.

Patchouli:
You power is manipulation of density, correct?
Becoming a mist... causing the banquets...
I wonder what "Oni" are weak against?

Suika:
Eh~? I'm strong. I'm not weak against anything.

Patchouli:
I remember. 
I'm certain they were weak against boiled soybeans...
But I don't have any on hand right now.

Suika:
Hmph.
You clearly have knowledge, but... 
looks like you can't do anything with it.
In the end, not a single being living in this ideal 
Gensokyo knows what's happening, right?

Patchouli:
What's happening...? 
Banquets... right?

Suika:
The power of an oni, the power to gather. Enjoy it to your heart's content!

Youmu:
When you consider the usual...

Reimu:
Ah? Are you alone today? What's your business?

Youmu:
Reimu is the most likely suspect.

Reimu:
It's a terrible business.

Youmu:
Well, yes. This is where everyone's been gathering for the feasts.

Reimu:
You're the ones holding the feasts in my shrine, right? 
If I were you, I'd hold them in your home.

Youmu:
That's what you say, but really, aren't you up to something? 
This suspicious atmosphere is beyond the usual.

Reimu:
You're the one giving it off, aren't you? Humans rarely release "suspicious atmospheres." 
Anyway, you say it's beyond the usual; what's your business here, anyways?

Youmu:
I came to slash the suspect.

Reimu:
I think you're pretty simple-minded.

Youmu:
You weren't the target what I was looking for.

Reimu:
Gee~z, can't you listen to your target without slashing them?

Youmu:
You're wrong. Slashing will tell me who the target should be.

Reimu:
That means you're just a maniac.

Youmu:
This is really...
It was a mistake to go out in the afternoon. 
I can't see the road at all.
It's completely dark now.

Marisa:
Oh? What an unfortunate sight to see at night.

Youmu:
I'm sorry for disturbing your rest...

Marisa:
There shouldn't be a phantom here. Ohmigod, ohmigod.

Youmu:
Phantoms and thunder are different!

Marisa:
So, what do you want, oh phantomic patron?

Youmu:
For the time being, I'm here to slash you. That's my story.

Marisa:
What an abrupt and dangerous thing to say...

Youmu:
You seem like the kind of person who'd tell lies. 
However...this sword doesn't lie.

Marisa:
I'll accept your challenge, out of respect for your coming to the Forest of Magic on a night like this.

Youmu:
Many-shaded black one, I will slash it in a single blow!

Youmu:
We~ll. Guess it's not you after all.

Marisa:
Ah~? After all of that, it's terrible how you just say 
something that makes no sense.

Youmu:
Someone who could spread a spiritual aura this wide...

Marisa:
Spiritual aura? Ah~, the thing with the spiritual aura. 
I have nothing to do with that.

Youmu:
Yeah, it looks like it.

Youmu:
This is my first time entering this place.
Although, I can't say I like such a dark place very much...

Patchouli:
Who's there?

Youmu:
Slash you.

Patchouli:
What's this? A vengeful spirit is in my library~.

Youmu:
Rather harsh to a vengeful ghost.
I didn't die with a grudge against everyone, 
and I'm not dead in the first place. I think.

Patchouli:
Ahh, at such a time, I should recite the exorcism chant....
What with you coming to a place like this.

Youmu:
Well, when we assume that the person who produces spiritual mist stays here, there's no doubt that this is the place.

Patchouli:
So?

Youmu:
I'm here to slash you.

Patchouli:
Ahh, you don't make sense and I don't understand.
...Well, it's a good chance to test new magic even if I don't understand.

Youmu:
Come on then, my slash takes you out.

Youmu:
It's not you. Nevertheless, there are other suspicious people in this mansion who are further inside...

Patchouli:
Hmm? 
Just a minute, this magic is still imperfect.

Youmu:
In spite of that, with all of the books in this library, you don't seems worried 
about all that fire and water going around.

Patchouli:
Of course. Resist fire, resist water, resist magic, resist ghost, ‚óã for all.

Youmu:
Oh~. However... there's nothing interesting in the books. 
They only have old things written in them.

Sakuya:
What's this, all of a sudden? How unusual it is for you to be here.

Youmu:
I'm getting worn out from work.

Sakuya:
Worn out from work?

Youmu:
I wonder if it's you? That spiritual aura, and the mastermind of the feast.

Sakuya:
What, what, spiritual aura?
Ahh, I'm sure it must be that terrible spiritual aura recently.

Youmu:
Is that all you think? 
It is somehow substantial.

Sakuya:
But, there's nothing happening to worry about, besides...
Compare it to the recent disaster, which caused a commotion 
when spring didn't arrive.

Youmu:
You're asking to be slashed again.

Sakuya:
Again?
It shows how you're lacking in study.
Furthermore, that word is a word used when the same thing happened in the past, and it is repeated.
And I don't remember being slashed.

Youmu:
When I slashed you, did I also slash your memory?
But even so, again, you're getting slashed.

Sakuya:
Really, did you come here just for slashing?

Youmu:
This isn't it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Sakuya:
Geez, what is this.

Youmu:
There's very little time left, I'll have to hurry.

Sakuya:
But still, I have to say, 
your breaking and entering degenerated into a joke, y'know.

Youmu:
That's a great misunderstanding.

Remilia:
Isn't it quite noisy. Really, what do you have to say about this?

Youmu:
I'm just about done slashing stuff, and you're the only one left.
This disaster is all your doing.

Remilia:
Disaster? What could that possibly be?

Youmu:
Explaining it is so...
Now, it's about that spiritual aura that's filling Gensokyo.

Remilia:
Ah, that? Is that such a big deal?
Look, there's virtually nothing happening.

Youmu:
You're not going to act unless it's too late?

Remilia:
If something doesn't happen... 
Acting solely on a guess becomes your only excuse.
As with everything, unless one acts only when the consequences are considered...
They're just being played with by fate.

Youmu:
That's a rather leisurely thing to say.

Remilia:
Aren't you the same to some degree, since you've lived a long time... wait, you are alive, aren't you?

Youmu:
The list of suspects who could release such a spiritual aura is almost gone.
Come on, let's see if you're the criminal and put you on trial.

Remilia:
You could say, since I'm not the one who's doing anything, that I'm innocent. 
Even if you put me on trial.
The trial however; how are you going to do it?

Youmu:
This sword, Hakurouken, shows the truth.

Youmu:
Was I wrong!? You're not the criminal.

Remilia:
Oh no, my clothes got dirty.
You didn't have to use the sword... 
I was telling the truth from the beginning.

Youmu:
I'm worried. Now, there's no one left on the list of suspects...

Remilia:
Oh, isn't your boss the most suspicious?

Youmu:
Well, that's expected... 
You could say, it's probable, but not likely.

Youmu:
Indeed, I would like to believe that this isn't the actions of Yuyuko-sama...

Reimu:
Well, you're here quite early. Alone today? 
There's still plenty of time until the feast.

Youmu:
We~ll. After all this, we still don't know who the one giving off this spiritual aura is.

Reimu:
Have you been going around all slashing people to find the criminal?

???:
You know, these are dangerous times.

Yukari:
Look here, you slashing your sword around too much and...
your place (Netherworld) will become completely full one of these days.

Youmu:
Huh? Yukari-sama. 
How unusual for you to be in a place like this.

Yukari:
It's because no one invites me to the feasts these days.
So, I decided to come here on my own, invited or not.

Youmu:
Nevertheless, why are you here all of a sudden?

Yukari:
It's because I've been called to come here.

Youmu:
You just said there's no invitation, nor anyone calling. Aren't you contradicting yourself?

Yukari:
Oh, your training must be insufficient. 
What do you think your eyes are there for?

Youmu:
Come on... there's nothing to consider. What are they for?

Yukari:
It's pleasant. If you have the feast. 
So, we gather together, right?

Youmu:
I got it.

Yukari:
You got it.

Youmu:
Yukari-sama is the perpetrator. This spiritual aura.

Yukari:
Again, it seems like you've severely short-circuited.

Youmu:
Yuyuko-sama, I'm sorry for doubting you. 
I forgot such a familiar and suspicious person as this.

Yukari:
I think it's terrible that you'd forget me.

Youmu:
Now, the sword can clear the hole in every border!

Youmu:
Ahh, again. Just what on earth does this mean!? 
How is it that Yukari-sama doesn't have...

Yukari:
She's still troubled even after losing her temper and slashing someone.

Youmu:
Geez, it's already time for the feast. 
In the end, neither the criminal nor the motive have been discovered.

Yukari:
Your training is insufficient.
It can't be helped, I'll give you a hint. 
Look here, there's still one more suspicious person.

Youmu:
Is it Yuyuko-sama after all¬†!¬†?

Yukari:
No, no, that's not it. 
Look, they're becoming visible. Even to your eyes.

Suika:
Err, umm, how do you do, I think?

Youmu:
Eh!? What? Who're you? 
Where on earth did you come from?

Suika:
I've been here since the beginning, from way back when. 
I've seen all the vicious things you've done.

Youmu:
Huh, the spiritual aura disappeared completely. 
You are a criminal, aren't you.

Suika:
Criminal, don't call a person a criminal. 
In the mannerism of samurai with special rights.

Youmu:
To begin with, what's your intention?
So you emitted the spiritual aura... 
It's not normal to be able to cover all of Gensokyo.

Suika:
I'm able to send the feast to everyone... 
within their subconscious.
Also, this spiritual aura isn't "emitted."

Youmu:
You're the spiritual aura over all of Gensokyo.
Right now actually, the spiritual aura disappeared when you came out...

Suika:
It's okay, I think?
Spiritual auras aren't limited to the ones ghosts give off.
Don't get caught up in stereotypes.
To begin with, what spiritual aura?
Unless you see it with a certain eye, the truth isn't visible. 
Your training isn't enough.

Youmu:
As for me...
Truth is not visible to the eye, nor audible to the ears,
Truth-slashing is something which you know, 
When it was taught by the master.
Therefore, everything doesn't begin unless you slash it. 
The sword is sure to lead to the truth.

Suika:
How amusing, this phantom.
You seem to me that you don't look like you understood your master's teachings.
To that...

Suika:
That sword, it hasn't slashed an oni, has it?

Youmu:
Oni?

Suika:
In other words, neither you nor that sword knows an oni.

Youmu:
What an oni is... I don't know. 
What are oni to begin with...

Suika:
The power of oni, power to gather, and power to disperse, 
to think that you could cut something like that...
It would be good to train you in that sword!

Sakuya:
You called for me. What's the matter?

Remilia:
I'll be out for a while.

Sakuya:
This late in the day? 
...Well, I suppose it's nothing out of the ordinary.

Remilia:
That's the story. Look after the mansion.

Sakuya:
What are you talking about? I'll follow you. It's dangerous in the night.

Remilia:
Who are you talking to? Besides, I have urgent business today.

Sakuya:
If so, leave it to me. I can deal with urgent businesses better than anyone in Gensokyo.

Remilia:
This is my own business. I have a plan to terrorize Gensokyo tonight.

Sakuya:
...Did anything happen? Tomorrow's the feast.

Remilia:
Something happened. I have little time, even for this conversation, Sakuya. Hurry up and go watch the mansion.

Remilia:
Now, look after the mansion.

Sakuya:
I got it... Please come back home before dawn.

Remilia:
I just remembered. I'll take a parasol for my safety.

Sakuya:
Won't you come back by sunrise?

Remilia:
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Take this to heart.

Remilia:
The night certainly suits this forest.

Marisa:
What's up? It's rare for you to be here so late.

Marisa:
Well, what's rare is that you're here; that it's late at night isn't.

Remilia:
I'm traveling around Gensokyo before the morning.

Marisa:
Ah~? 
That's a short trip, alright.

Remilia:
Quite. That's why I have to defeat you and go as soon as possible.

Marisa:
Anyway, I'd never thought you'd come here. 
To this forest, this late at night.

Remilia:
It's because it's this late. Remember that if you underestimate me, you'll be in severe pain.

Marisa:
...So what's your business here, anyway?

Remilia:
I'll be a star in the tomorrow's feast. Do remember.

Marisa:
Did you just come here to tell me that?

Remilia:
I shall never give my initiative to such a suspicious and mysterious character.

Remilia:
A shrine around 2:00 a.m.... 
But the shrine maiden doesn't sleep.

Reimu:
It was you that woke me up, OK? 
I wanna sleep.

Remilia:
I'm in a bit of a hurry. 
Would you mind losing immediately?

Reimu:
If that's the case, I wish you'd have ignored me and left.

Remilia:
I'll steal everyone's power by tomorrow.

Reimu:
Ah~?

Remilia:
That's why I'll defeat you and hurry up. 
No, defeat you immediately? 
Whatever.

Reimu:
Mm. Youkai showing up at the witching hour can't be good.

Remilia:
Now, be obedient.

Remilia:
Next, I'll try to die.

Reimu:
I was woken up late at night and attacked... 
What a nuisance.

Remilia:
I take the initiative tomorrow, so listen to me.

Reimu:
OK, OK. You're supreme.

Remilia:
Now, I'll go die for a while.

Remilia:
I can hardly go to the Netherworld.

Youmu:
It's about time the day breaks... 
Here's an unexpected being in the unexpected time. 
Hurry up and tell me your business here. 
Otherwise...

Remilia:
My business is defeating you. OK?

Youmu:
That was quick.

Remilia:
I wanna defeat most of them before the morning. 
It's already half past 3. 
I have don't have much time before daybreak.

Youmu:
Just relax. 
First of all, tell me your purpose.

Remilia:
For you to lose to me. What's my other business to you?

Youmu:
Gee, that doesn't tell me enough! 
This's why I hate devils~.

Remilia:
Now, be obedient.

Remilia:
I could defeat, at most, one more considering the time.

Youmu:
I see, I see. I got down as you said. Are you satisfied?

Remilia:
You did well. As you said, I'm happy.

Youmu:
I'm used to unreasonable orders.

Remilia:
Such wonderful obedience. I've got to retrain my maid.

Yuyuko:
Oh, good morning.

Yuyuko:
You're up early.

Remilia:
It's just past 4 o'clock. 
Do you wake up this early often? 
You seem like an old lady.

Yuyuko:
Even old men won't drop by my house this early in the morning.

Remilia:
To me, this is bedtime. 
Early to bed and early to rise is my motto.

Yuyuko:
So, what's your business? I wonder why you came here alone.

Remilia:
I ask you to leave tomorrow's feast to me.

Yuyuko:
Not tomorrow, but tonight... 
But I'm concerned that I leave something to you. 
Wait, that's your business to say so, isn't it?

Remilia:
Never mind. Tomorrow's feast will be one like you've never experienced.

Yuyuko:
If I leave it to you, I'm sure it will be.

Remilia:
It's dawn. 
Hold your tongue and be obedient.

Yuyuko:
Shall I play with you instead of your servant ‚Äôtill daybreak?

Remilia:
Now, shut up and enjoy a dirt nap.

Remilia:
It's morning. The sun is about to rise... 
I have to go home quickly and sleep.

Yuyuko:
I got it. Tomorrow, no, tonight, 
I'll leave tonight's feast to you.

Remilia:
Recently my initiative has always been taken by some strange being.

Yuyuko:
Ah, haven't you realized? 
I don't care how anyone behaves... 
As long as it's fun.

Remilia:
Tonight, no, tomorrow's night will be fun.

Reimu:
You're early. Well, I guess it's because you're in charge of tonight's feast?

Remilia:
Do you know who has been controlling these feasts up to now?

Reimu:
Up to now... I guess it's Marisa, the arranger.

Remilia:
I'd be relieved if it was just her. 
You'd better concentrate more as a shrine maiden.

???:
Oh, dear.

Yukari:
Don't tell Reimu things that will bother her.

Remilia:
Ah? The one who was never invited just showed up.

Yukari:
I don't know what you're plotting.

Remilia:
What I'm plotting? 
I'm trying to find the plotter.

Yukari:
Huhuhu. 
Shall I arrange this feast?

Remilia:
This idea makes me much wonder what you plot, doesn't it?

Yukari:
Such jolly paticipants are all mine.

Remilia:
What a coincidence that I thought the same idea.

Yukari:
If so, you could tell without any words.

Remilia:
...Now, be obedient.

Yukari:
My, I'm obedient from the beginning~.

Remilia:
It's about time you say the truth. 
Who really arranges the feast?

Yukari:
OK. 
However, I don't want to say... 
I'll tell you if you wanna meet her.

Remilia:
It's impressive for you to be obedient.

Yukari:
I'm obedient from the beginning. 
Unlike you and your attendant.

Remilia:
Your playtime is over. 
You brat.

Suika:
Huh~? 
I thought I'd get to play a lot longer.

Remilia:
Haven't you already played long enough? 
I didn't care about you for a long time, though.

Suika:
Well, it's OK.

Suika:
I guess I can have a great playtime at the end.

Remilia:
You can. 
Or rather this is the true playtime.

Suika:
But... I wish it were the one. 
You're not far comparable with me. 
Don't tell me that a vampire like you, 
can defeat oni like us.

Remilia:
Defeating or blah blah blah... 
You're not far comparative with me, OK? 
Don't tell me that the crude native like you, 
can defeat the noble aristocrat like me.

Suika:
Shall we make sure the comparison?

Remilia:
Yeah. It's good to do it.

Suika:
Um? Now I remember. You've never seen any oni. 
You've just come to Gensokyo.

Remilia:
What are you saying? 
Residents all over Gensokyo call me like this: 
Kyuuketsu-ki.
["Âê∏Ë°ÄÈ¨º" (Kyuuketsuki) means "vampire". The last character "È¨º" can be read not only "oni" but "ki". Remilia implied she was also the "oni" like Suika.]

Suika:
If you're so, you'll understand. Oni represents the strength. 
You think you're strong, but the oni is also strong. 
My power, is forgathering, which only oni can control... 
Lose and realize your weakness before the power that you'll never know!

Youmu:
Oh? Are you going out?

Yuyuko:
Yes, the weather is so nice; 
why don't you go out too every once in a while?

Youmu:
I work outside, all the time.

Yuyuko:
By the way, what is your duty, anyway?

Youmu:
Huh? Oh ... I see. I guess I'll come with you.

Yuyuko:
Wrong. You're the guard, aren't you?

Youmu:
Uhh yes, my duty includes that...

Yuyuko:
A real sentinel... 
... has to guard people from inside to getting out.

Yuyuko:
Well, keep up the hard work.

Yuyuko:
Such less dependable attitude, I'm worried.

Youmu:
Don't worry my lady. I won't let anyone pass here.

Yuyuko:
Hmm, maybe I should have hard time when I return here.

Marisa:
Huh? What are you doing around here?

Yuyuko:
Well, I did come here on purpose ... 
So it's all for you-know-what, right?

Marisa:
Oh, that.
Even so, it's unusual for ghosts to show up here in broad daylight. 
How reckless.

Yuyuko:
Who, you? Or the shrine maiden?

Marisa:
You and her.

Yuyuko:
Correct.

Marisa:
It wouldn't be so weird if it were night. 
Even for a ghost like you.

Yuyuko:
There are ghosts during the day, too, you know.

Yuyuko:
So, where's the other reckless person?

Marisa:
Well, she ought to be making tea over there somewhere, 
or maybe she's already drinking it.

Yuyuko:
Such strange choices.

Marisa:
Oh, really?

Yuyuko:
Yes. Especially the second one.

Reimu:
Geez, you come through here and make a mess just after I swept! 
Totally defeats the purpose.

Yuyuko:
Oh, I thought you cleaned up so it would be easier to fight.

Reimu:
Anyway, where's Marisa?

Yuyuko:
Over there pouring tea, 
Or maybe over there drinking tea, I suppose.

Reimu:
Hmm.

Yuyuko:
In any case, it's your turn for tea time.

Reimu:
Well, I guess I'll have some, then.

Yuyuko:
But first, it's time for ... you-know-what.

Reimu:
Huh? Oh, that.

Yuyuko:
Yes, that.

Reimu:
You sure are pretty spirited for a ghost.

Yuyuko:
You should really only have tea in the shrine. 
I wonder if I could have a cup, too.

Reimu:
Don't you mean, you can only have saury of Meguro, or something ...¬†?

Yuyuko:
Ah, but I have to be on my way quickly today.

Reimu:
You're always so carefree, even more so than I. 
Wouldn't it be okay to have just a cup?

Yuyuko:
It's just a tea break. 
I should wait until tomorrow for the full stomach.

Sakuya:
It seems that a ghost has appeared before me ...
Am I that much of an inspiration?

Yuyuko:
So, it's time for that.

Sakuya:
That? By the way, don't you have feet?

Yuyuko:
Why, I've got a left foot next to a right foot. 
That's just common sense.

Sakuya:
So, what are you doing in a place like this?

Yuyuko:
Hmm. Didn't I already say I came for you-know-what?

Sakuya:
You mean ... nirvana?

Yuyuko:
Yes, nirvana.

Sakuya:
If you don't give it back you may not like my response.

Yuyuko:
Well, the shrine maiden couldn't put up a fight either, 
so I don't think you can make it to nirvana, either.

Sakuya:
You know ... there's something wrong about asking a 
shrine maiden to achieve nirvana.

Yuyuko:
Just who said they wanted to achieve nirvana, I wonder?

Sakuya:
Don't you think you need to say more?

Yuyuko:
If it seems so, that's because you've got both 
the long part and the short part.
In such a case, it seems like there's nothing there to a normal person.

Sakuya:
And I suppose I am an ordinary person. 
But ultimately, you'll become invisible if you have the short part. 
I wonder if someone as carefree as you can see me?

Yuyuko:
Well, it looks like I can win whether or not 
I can see you moving.

Sakuya:
Ahh, it feels horrible to lose to someone with no real aim.

Yuyuko:
Well, there is something I'm trying to do.

Sakuya:
I doubt that.

Yuyuko:
It's an invisible enemy. 
Maybe you'll be able to see them tomorrow.

Remilia:
What is happening? 
It's so noisy here.

Yuyuko:
Tomorrow should be fun, as I worked so hard. I'm sure of it.

Remilia:
Such an active ghost. 
What do you want?

Yuyuko:
Everyone thinks they have their free will, but they don't realize they're being manipulated.
So, today I moved freely to make everyone cannot have their free will.
If everything goes well, maybe we can see something interesting tomorrow.

Remilia:
Hm, that's not what I asked, but ... 
Will I be able to see this interesting thing as well?

Yuyuko:
Something interesting? I wonder what it could be.

Remilia:
Well, that's quite ...
I see. That's your way to disturb the puppet master's intent. 
Should I do something like that, too?

Yuyuko:
By the way, I've found a new tea (Atarashii Ocha).

Remilia:
Hm, or "shincha", for short. Where is this from?

Yuyuko:
The shrine.

Remilia:
Is this really new?

Yuyuko:
It's the god's new tea, or "koucha" for short.

Remilia:
I don't like that jargon ... 
But I don't need it. I only drink the black tea.

Yuyuko:
I wonder, can the predetermined tomorrow be changed by this?

Remilia:
You sure are roundabout. 
I'd rather go for the puppet master in a more straightforward fashion.

Yuyuko:
Hm, haven't you heard the phrase, "more haste, less speed"?

Remilia:
"Time is precious-metal-whatsoever", you know.

Yuyuko:
A silver knife.
But you know, a silver cup has the property of 
being able to stop time.

Reimu:
Good evening. But, you're early, you know. 
This a bit of time before the feast. Want some tea?

Yuyuko:
Has anything strange or interesting happened lately?

Reimu:
Well ... 
You mean as strange as a weird ghost coming by yesterday?

???:
That's no good.

Yukari:
To protect against being manipulated, you jumble up your own intentions.

Yukari:
You always do things so half-heartedly.

Yuyuko:
Oh, really? But look, you showing up weren't part of the plan.

Yukari:
Well, when I see a friend gallantly trying her best, you know.

Yuyuko:
You want to ridicule her? Since we're talking about you here.

Yukari:
No, I want to beat her.

Yuyuko:
Oh, by the way, I found a new tea.

Yukari:
Oh, what a surprise. Me too.

Yuyuko:
Is that so?
Then do you know about how the fresh scent of tea 
fades away with time?

Yukari:
That's too bad. I don't, since my tea's scent doesn't fade. 
Ever.

Yuyuko:
In fact ...
The scent of fresh tea just spreads out and gets weaker, it 
never actually goes away.

Yukari:
How indirect.

Yuyuko:
So, there's a way to gather back all the 
scent that's spread out ...
That is, to make a big boundary surrounding it 
suddenly very small. Please.

Yukari:
I guess I have no choice. 
After all, Yuyuko asked me to.

Suika:
Ah, you found me. 
All thanks to your strange ramblings.

Yuyuko:
Oh my. Just when I thought I'd finally found those 
memories, it turns out to be a little demon ...

Suika:
And I thought I'd be able to play a little more.
I didn't think that a strange ghost like you would 
come out and spoil my fun.

Yuyuko:
...Oni wouldn't have any fragrance or anything.

Suika:
How rude. 
You called me out to gather all the fresh scent back, right?

Yuyuko:
A white cedar is more fragrant than its buds. 
Even a dirty little demon like you should know that.

Suika:
Is that supposed to be a compliment?
This scent I've gathered. 
Does it bear your mark on purpose? Or by chance?

Yuyuko:
It's okay if kids like you don't understand.

Suika:
Treating an oni like a kid, huh... You sure've got some guts, don't ya.
Or is it just that you're already dead?

Yuyuko:
Now that you mention it, it seems I've found a new tea.

Suika:
... you know, I am here, so there's no point in 
changing the topic back to that ...
Hmm, was it really something natural, and not on purpose?

Yuyuko:
Of course it's all-natural. 
It is the tea from the shrine.

Suika:
There's no way shrine tea could be natural.

Suika:
So, you want to compare which has the better scent, 
me or that tea from the shrine.

Yuyuko:
Hmm? Amazing.

Suika:
Oh, the amazing part is coming right up.

Yuyuko:
Actually, I was talking about starting now.

Suika:
I'm ... a natural demon.
So my powers ... 
My powers aren't useless, like you!

Yukari:
Oh, the vampire passing by there. 
May I borrow a bit of your time?

Remilia:
Who is it? 
I was about to sleep, too.

Remilia:
So how'd you get in here?

Yukari:
Let's switch topics for a bit. 
You wouldn't happen to have any quality sake would you?

Remilia:
Topics... 
Pretty inconvenient to switch it when there wasn't really one in the first place.

Yukari:
Denki Bran.

Remilia:
Brandy.
What about it? 
I hope you're not going to suggest we drink the night away together.

Yukari:
Why do I have to drink with you?
I came here for your sake. 
Tomorrow is the banquet, after all...

Remilia:
Silly fool. I've no idea how you got in, 
but I'll drive you out of here.

Remilia:
A lack of potassium.

Yukari:
Calcium.

Yukari:
The sun is rising.

Remilia:
No helping it. 
If it's just brandy, I'll share some.

Yukari:
Really? It's fine? 
You've got a soft spot after all.

Remilia:
...

Yukari:
That warm fire~‚ô™ 
Has taken your life and vanished~‚ô™

Yukari:
The transient fire~‚ô™ 
Vanishes by the hand of the strict wind~‚ô™
Oh, the magician passing by there. 
May I borrow a bit of your time?

Alice:
Hm, who is it? 
How'd you manage to come all the way here?

Yukari:
By singing.

Alice:
A drifter? 
You're just in time.

Yukari:
You have some nice sake as well.

Alice:
This isn't some bar on the outskirts. 
If you're a drifter, try somewhere else.

Yukari:
Van Allen radiation belt.

Alice:
Wine.

Yukari:
I came here to pick that up.

Yukari:
It's not too sudden. 
Look, I've even brought a formal announcement form.

Alice:
I don't think having that really...

Yukari:
And with this, I've taken the wine as well.

Alice:
"Wine as well", are you taking something else?

Yukari:
Well, let's see... 
How about that fragile looking biscuit?

Alice:
Biscuit...? 
Why would there be a biscuit anywhere?

Yukari:
Below the stone without a drop of blood~‚ô™ 
Below the eternal stone~‚ô™
Oh, the half-ghost passing by there. 
May I borrow a bit of your time?

Youmu:
Oh? Yukari-sama. 
Although it's the usual, you're always so sudden.

Yukari:
My, what a greeting.
Shall I tattle to Yuyuko? 
Thirty percent yes, eighty percent no.

Youmu:
I didn't even say anything bad~

Yukari:
By the by, you had some fine sake as well.

Youmu:
Fine sake? 
I'm not sure if it's fine, but I do have some for tonight...

Yukari:
De Broglie wave.

Youmu:
It's unrefined sake. 
It's for tonight so I can't give it to you.

Yukari:
Now, now, don't be stingy.

Yukari:
And I finally obtain unrefined sake~.

Youmu:
Are you coming to tonight's banquet, Yukari-sama?

Yukari:
I'm going today. I wasn't invited, though.

Youmu:
Then, please bring that sake with you.

Yukari:
I'm planning on bringing along someone else with me. 
It'll definitely be lively.

Yukari:
Towering stone tower~‚ô™ 
Rotting town of machines~‚ô™
Oh, the human passing by there. 
May I borrow a bit of your time?

Marisa:
Eh? What? 
I'm about to head out, here.

Yukari:
Head out, to the shrine you mean?

Marisa:
The banquet does start tonight.
Wait, you're coming too? 
I never know where you are so I didn't invite you.

Yukari:
Let's switch topics for a bit. 
You have some cheap sake don't you?

Marisa:
It's okay sake. 
What about it?

Yukari:
Mysterious shouchuu.

Marisa:
Normal shouchuu. 
Don't make it seem like some parasite (kiseichu).

Yukari:
I came to take that.

Marisa:
I can't let you drink it now. 
I'll have nothing to bring with me for tonight if you do.

Yukari:
If you don't stop complaining and refuse to hand it over, 
I'll make it so you can't get out of the forest.

Yukari:
I wonder who'll pass by me next?

Marisa:
So you're coming to the banquet after all? 
If I don't have that sake it'll be a problem for me, though.

Yukari:
I'm going to the banquet. 
But, don't worry.

Marisa:
Don't worry?

Yukari:
Nobody is going to bring any sake tonight. 
Aside from me... and a certain other.

Yukari:
The crumbling castle of sand~‚ô™ 
Melting away is the kingdom of earth~‚ô™
Oh, the shrine maiden passing by there. 
May I have a bit of your time?

Reimu:
Huh? 
What's it today?

Reimu:
Hey, you're the one passing by.

Yukari:
My, you're the first to point that out, Reimu.

Reimu:
Everyone is just slow. 
So, what do you want?

Yukari:
Let's switch topics for a bit. 
If I recall correctly, you have some pretty good sake too.

Reimu:
I do have some normal sake... 
It's sake for tonight.

Yukari:
Ginjoushu.

Reimu:
Yeah, it's probably Ginjoushu. 
But it's from outside, so it's imported sake.

Yukari:
Mind handing it over?

Reimu:
What the heck. 
It's still being offered on the alter, so no.

Yukari:
That sake, how do you think it ended up where it did?

Reimu:
I found it left in the household shrine. 
Isn't that how it goes?

Yukari:
I wonder if there are any more gods in the outside world?

Yukari:
And sacred sake I have received~.

Reimu:
You know, everyone's gathering here already. 
What's the point of taking the sake now?

Yukari:
For drinking at the banquet, of course.

Reimu:
Well, that's true, but...

Yukari:
Let's look forward to tonight's banquet. It'll definitely be fun.

Yukari:
Only the sky is~ the same azure as it ever was~‚ô™ 
The kingdom~ in ruins~ leaving but mountains and rivers~‚ô™
Oh, Yuyuko, it hasn't been too much of a while, has it?

Yuyuko:
What's the matter? 
You're causing quite the commotion before the banquet

Yukari:
What do you think is the matter? 
You don't intend to start the same old banquet now, do you?

Yuyuko:
I do and always did intend to.

Yukari:
You're really slow, Yuyuko. 
I thought you might've started taking action, but...

Yuyuko:
I wonder what you're talking about.

Yukari:
Let's switch topics for a bit. 
That sake you have there, it's really old, isn't it?

Yuyuko:
Not at all. 
Its best before date is still thousands of years ahead.

Yukari:
Since you're not making efficient use of it, I'll have you hand it over.

Yuyuko:
My, my, and I wanted to enjoy it with everyone tonight.

Yukari:
Of course, "everyone" will be drinking tonight.

Yuyuko:
Are you going to poison it?

Yukari:
The opposite, I'll be removing the poison.

Yuyuko:
Sharp as ever, I guess the fact that I put it in 
from the beginning was too obvious.

Yukari:
And with this... 
I think all the people who might've brought sake are now left empty-handed.

Yuyuko:
What might you be up to?

Yukari:
You already know that though, Yuyuko.

Yuyuko:
Drinking sake with "everyone", right?

Yukari:
Now then, it's about time to end the fun and games.

Suika:
Eeh~ Yukari~, what's up?

Yukari:
I don't mind the string pulling and gathering everyone, but... 
If you don't stop soon, they're going to start to notice.

Suika:
There's no way they'd notice.

Suika:
And even if they did, 
I'm an oni. I've nothing to fear.

Yukari:
Even if every single one was against you?

Suika:
What're you up to?

Yukari:
You know the sake for the banquet today? There isn't any. 
What do you think will happen at this rate if 
I don't bring any sake to the banquet?

Suika:
You'll be killed, Yukari?

Yukari:
My, that might be so. 
But what if I say that you drank it all. 
Even if it's me, there's no way I could've drank it all.

Suika:
Aaah! No fair, that's cheap!

Yukari:
No matter how anyone looks at it, there's a nice little sake-loving Suika. 
Wonderful, isn't it. 
Everyone will become enemies. 
Enemies to me and you.

Suika:
Even though it's always so, I gotta say your tricks are dirty.

Yukari:
Now you have no other option save for appearing before everyone, 
and if you do, your ability's cover will be blown. 
Banquets will be as everyone wills from then on.

Suika:
Buuut, even if I show myself, we're going to stay as their enemies, aren't we? 
Because Yukari's the one who stole everyone's sake, right?

Yukari:
My, that might be so.

Suika:
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Yukari:
But no need to worry. We'll show them your gourd at the banquet. 
It'll pour out all the sake anyone wants, no? Everyone will be overjoyed.

Suika:
I found a better way.

Yukari:
Will you play innocent?

Suika:
I'll blame it all on Yukari. 
Actually, I have a feeling it was all your fault in the first place. 
I'll take you along with that sake to everyone else!

Suika:
Hmm? 
Have I been spotted already?

Sakuya:
I finally got you. You're the culprit, aren't you?

Sakuya:
Who are you, anyway?

Suika:
I know all about you. 
I've been watching you for a long time.
You're the one taking care of cooking and cleaning during the feast. 
That's quite admirable.
However, no one notices that. 
No one appreciates you.

Sakuya:
Don't you think it'd be a little rude to start cleaning 
while the party is still going on?
That's why I try to not let anyone notice when I clean up.
I will not have people worry about me. 
That's how it should be.
By the way, who are you?

Suika:
Isn't it you who came to me?

Sakuya:
I was brought here by a troubled person.

Suika:
Lies. You're getting tired of cooking and cleaning up, aren't you?

Suika:
Don't even think that you weak humans will match us oni!

Sakuya:
Match oni...? 
Us?

Suika:
Well, everyone's waiting. 
Get going.

Sakuya:
How vexing...

Suika:
They're waiting for dinner to come.

Suika:
Hmm~? 
I thought I'd be able to play a bit more.

Alice:
Who are you?

Suika:
Really, is there nothing else on your mind?

Alice:
I don't know who you are, so it can't be helped, right?
By the way, I'm...

Suika:
Oh yes, I know all about you. 
I've always been watching you.
You only talk to humans at the feasts, and no one else. 
Do you wish to be human?
Or maybe you don't want to be too involved with anyone who is 
stronger than you?
But you don't understand that those humans are the scariest ones. 
How pitiful.

Alice:
Maybe that just means I'm the bravest of all?
Rather, those people are acting like youkai. Therefore, 
you make fun of them.
So, who are you? Where is this place?

Suika:
It seems that's all you can say.

Alice:
Since you suddenly appeared in front of me, it can't be helped, right?

Suika:
Lies. You're starting to realize what true solitude is, right?

Suika:
Do not think that magic on that level matches us oni.

Alice:
How strong...
Just what is this power?

Suika:
Well, the usual feast is about to start.

Alice:
For now... 
I will grace it with my presence.

Suika:
I think it will start whether you're there or not.

Suika:
Hmm? 
Have I been spotted again?

Youmu:
Who the heck are you?

Suika:
Geez, how tiresome. 
Everyone just keeps asking "who?" and "where?".

Youmu:
I only said the first one, though. 
I haven't asked "where?" yet.
Oh, right. Where is this place?

Suika:
And there's the second one. I really do know all about you. 
I've always been watching you.
Everyone at the feast keeps teasing you, hm? 
Ah, how pitiful.
While you were participating in the feast, little by little, 
you were investigating me.
I can't stand it.

Youmu:
Investigating you?
I was just a little uneasy because of that strange mist that thickens 
every time there's a feast.
...Wait, are you the one behind that?

Suika:
The sword is sharp, but it seems like the same can't be said of the wielder...

Youmu:
That's... that's because Lady Yuyuko and Lady Yukari 
keep saying those bizzare things I can't understand...

Suika:
Ah, don't trust what Yukari says. 
Her very existence is fraudulent.

Suika:
You're weaker than Yukari. How boring.

Youmu:
Why is the sword reacting strangely...?

Suika:
It looks like this was its first experience with an oni.

Youmu:
Oni? 
An oni...

Suika:
The feast is already starting. If you don't go, 
that shrine maiden might become the butt of their jokes instead.

Suika:
Geeeeez. 
They keep finding me!

Patchouli:
Who are you...? Where did you come from?

Suika:
I am Suika Ibuki! I've been here since the beginning!

Patchouli:
...Why are you making so much noise in the first place?

Suika:
I'm sick of having to do the same thing over and over here 
for the past three days.
But, I know all about you. 
I've always been watching you.
You always look so bored at the festivals. 
You never say much, so it's like people forget you're even there.
But, it's really the thing you look forward to the most, right? 
You're always lonely since you usually don't get out much.
So is it curiosity that finally brings you before me? 
Or, maybe...
Is it just a show?

Patchouli:
You're noisy.
Being talkative is proof of irritability.
And getting angry will get you beaten in a fight.

Suika:
Then, that means the loser is the angry one.

Patchouli:
Indeed.

Suika:
That's too bad. I am rather irritated.

Suika:
Don't think that such pedestrian elementalism can match us oni.

Patchouli:
Oni...

Suika:
Well, the feast is about to start. 
Be a good girl and get back to it already.

Patchouli:
I'll research all about the oni until next time...

Suika:
Useless, useless, usele~ss! There isn't any data. 
Go back to your library and be terrified.

Suika:
Geez, it's getting to be more of a pain. 
I wonder if I'll get beaten soon.

Marisa:
Who are you? Don't tell me a brat like you is the culprit?
It's nothing to brag about even if I win.

Suika:
Take that back. I won't lose to you.

Marisa:
If you don't take this seriously, it won't be any 
fun for me, either.

Suika:
I know all about you. 
You're no match for me.
Weren't you the lively one at the feast? 
A lot more than when you're alone, that's for sure.
But thanks to your liveliness, you became the manager of the feast. 
Instead of me.
After all, it's not that unnatural if you're the one 
holding the feast.

Marisa:
Ah~? Are you joking?
I'm the one who decided to have the feast. 
Getting everyone together makes it more lively.
If you're going to go that far, why don't you come, too? 
Nobody's going to say you can't.

Suika:
That personality. 
Just as I expected.

Marisa:
But first, I have to apprehend the criminal in front of me.

Suika:
I won't lose to you.

Suika:
Huh, how boring.

Marisa:
What did you expect? We'll keep the festival going 
until you show up, so just come whenever.

Suika:
So... the feast will continue.

Marisa:
I'm heading back. After all, it won't do for the 
feast manager not to show up.

Suika:
Do your best to make it nice and lively~

Suika:
It's been a while since I came to Gensokyo. 
How many more feasts will there be until people notice my powers?
Actually, the opponents are too weak. 
I'm starting to get bit bored now.

Remilia:
Ah, so you're the one covering Gensokyo 
like it's yours?

Suika:
Oh, welcome. So you're this week's guest.

Remilia:
I don't know who you are... 
But I will not allow such behavior.

Suika:
I know all about you.
You're always so selfish at the feasts. 
Or maybe you're just selfish all the time?
In reality, you were always concerned about my presence. 
Well, even though I was spread pretty thin...
Still, you didn't make a move because...

Remilia:
What are you talking about?

Suika:
You actually wanted someone else... a human to notice.

Remilia:
Of course. Youkai hunting is a human's task.

Suika:
But you were a little worried, right?

Remilia:
Everyone else is too slow. I couldn't stand it.

Suika:
Lies.
It's because you thought I was too strong. 
Because you thought humans would be no match for me!

Suika:
You've still got a ways to go.
Your power isn't even close to that of an oni.

Remilia:
I'm out of time today.
I heard Sakuya calling from the feast.

Suika:
Right. The feast will begin now.
You'd better hurry.

Remilia:
I'll beat you next time.

Suika:
How direct... Well, only on that point.

Reimu:
You! You're the one creating this strange fog.

Suika:
Well, it's just about time to stop playing around.

Reimu:
You're acting weak all of a sudden. 
Well, you're the culprit, right?

Suika:
I really didn't expect everyone to be this slow.
I wanted to gather everyone to make a feast. 
The fog you're talking about is actually me.

Reimu:
Feast? What does the fog have to do with it?

Suika:
Hm... Even though it's been a long time since we oni left Gensokyo... 
I never thought we'd be forgotten.

Reimu:
Oni? Oni have been gone for a long time, now. 
You can't fool me with lies like that.

Suika:
Me? Lie!?
Get real! We oni never lie to humans!
Only humans tell lies!

Reimu:
Really?

Suika:
Well, maybe a little.
But it's not a lie that I dislike lying. 
You're a human who doesn't trick others.
I know all about you people 
I've always been watching you.
At the feast, and even at other times ... 
You were incredibly honest and impossible to get a hold of.
What were you really thinking?

Reimu:
I wasn't really thinking anything. 
I wonder if you had bad experiences with lies before ...
Anyway, I really have 
to punish you a little now.

Suika:
Alright. It might be nice to give the victory 
to a honest person.
But first, I have to show my respect to you, 
since you came all this way.

Reimu:
Hmm?
Wait... that's kind of strange.

Suika:
Now... Let the gathering power of the oni, long since disappeared from Gensokyo-
Soak into your body 
and make you recall the fear ingrained into humans since ancient times!

Reimu:
In that case, the food's on you today.

Reimu:
You can't beat me with that 
worn, weak, straightforward style...

Reimu:
By the way...
Recently there's been sake on the altar... 
that wasn't you was it?

Reimu:
Well, go get some tea.

Reimu:
Speaking of which...
There were knives left behind the shrine the other day. 
Please clean up after yourself!

Reimu:
Speaking of dolls, there were some nailed to the trees 
behind the shrine the other day. Was that your doing?

Reimu:
Don't play with fire in front of me. 
You can't beat me with fire.

Reimu:
Don't run and cut at the same time. 
It's dangerous.

Reimu:
Speaking of which, I haven't seen you in a while. 
Is it monsoon season?

Reimu:
If a shrine maiden lost to a ghost, then it'd be all over.

Reimu:
You always show up at the worst times... 
since you're not around at the worst times.

Reimu:
So... did you patch up the border 
with the Netherworld yet?
I feel like there are still ghosts coming...

Reimu:
Are those chains... 
just decorations?

Reimu:
That gourd...
Isn't it heavy, hanging around your waist all the time? 
There's stuff inside, right?

Reimu:
I win, again.

Reimu:
Well, we'll fight after we have tea.

Reimu:
Wait... you were here?

Marisa:
Ah, you lack discipline. 
Should I show you to a waterfall?

Marisa:
Did you know?
Kourin's worrying about the feasts. 
He's more worried about the mist, though.

Marisa:
Tea time, tea time. 
Even if we have coffee, it's tea time.

Marisa:
...Moving dolls are sorta creepy.

Marisa:
If you don't use your magic efficiently, 
you'll cancel it out, you know?

Marisa:
Come to think of it...
I feel like a book I returned a long time ago isn't actually there.

Marisa:
A sword... can't beat my firepower. 
Since it's metal, you know?

Marisa:
You're alone today? 
Don't tell me you got lost.

Marisa:
All things considered, there's something wrong with ghosts 
being able to move around freely in Gensokyo.

Marisa:
I can't lose to someone who's drunk. 
That's not drunken fist, is it? You're just hammered.

Marisa:
Huh? I felt like I just ran something over... 
Eh, I guess I'm imagining things.

Marisa:
Hardly a challenge. 
I'm always serious, though.

Marisa:
Anyways, if you're not serious, 
I won't be either.

Marisa:
There's... nothing dangerous at all.

Sakuya:
Well, let's stop with the greetings and have tea, shall we?

Sakuya:
You're wasting calories by using so much strength. 
Or, are you on a diet?

Sakuya:
To be able to control so many dolls at once... 
I won't lose at dexterity, though.

Sakuya:
Oh, today's red tea... 
Did it not please you?

Sakuya:
A longsword and throwing knives... Which one has better reach? 
I think I know already.

Sakuya:
Okay, stop with the games...

Sakuya:
Speaking of which... did you realize?
We have to find out the reason 
for this mist soon or else.

Sakuya:
As punishment, go retrieve my knives. 
It's easy for you, right?

Sakuya:
Don't slack off. 
Unlike me, you have limited time.

Sakuya:
It's customary to clean up after oneself. 
I have to retrieve my knives quickly...

Sakuya:
Your time is mine. 
Well, it'd be nice if you had something else besides time, but...

Alice:
Aw, geez! I need more than just a few dolls 
to deal with you.

Alice:
If someone like you fights with full power... 
I'll feel bad for the dolls.

Alice:
I control my dolls better than you control your knives.

Alice:
By the way...
Your library is free, right? 
Even if your collection keeps increasing like this...

Alice:
How dangerous. 
What are you going to do if your sword cuts my dolls?

Alice:
...I wish I had a doll from the outside world.

Alice:
I'm not alone. There's no way I could lose.

Alice:
Perhaps... 
I could win using only dolls.

Patchouli:
I was prepared. 
To beat you... wasabi's good.

Patchouli:
I was prepared. 
To beat you... use eel.

Patchouli:
I was prepared. 
To beat you... use Asian ginseng.

Patchouli:
I was prepared. 
To beat you... use chili peppers, I guess?

Patchouli:
I was prepared. 
To beat you... use bitter melons. Just like Sakuya.

Patchouli:
As expected, you have lots of weaknesses... 
If you don't catch me by surprise, you know you can't win, right?

Patchouli:
By the way...
Recently, hasn't the full moon been shaking a bit? 
I bet someone's up to something.

Patchouli:
The undead are weak against fire. 
I've exposed your weak point.

Patchouli:
You... Judging from the seasons you're active in, 
you're probably weak against dried plums.

Patchouli:
I brought some fried beans. 
There's no way you can win.

Patchouli:
There have been lots of mice in the library recently, 
but it seems our cats are just sieves...

Patchouli:
If you can find their weakness, you can beat anyone.

Patchouli:
All things have their attributes. 
Attributes and weaknesses are the same.

Youmu:
If you're going to move that slowly, you'll never get out of 
the reach of my sword.

Youmu:
They say it takes 50 years 
for one to be able to cut air.
I feel like I haven't spent that much time yet.

Youmu:
Don't use all your strength. 
It's easy for me to cut you down if you use strength.

Youmu:
They say it takes 30 years 
for one to be able to cut rain.
You can't even reach the lowest raindrops yet.

Youmu:
You can't beat blades with such short knives. 
You never stood a chance.

Youmu:
They say it takes 200 years 
for one to be able to cut time.
...a long way to go.

Youmu:
The sharpness of this sword isn't for slashing devils. 
It's a sharpness that sends things from this world to the world of the dead.

Youmu:
Okay, how about we stop screwing around and go home?

Youmu:
Oh, it's rare for you to be here.

Youmu:
The things that can't be cut by this 
youkai-tempered Roukanken are next to none!

Youmu:
You never had a chance. 
You're an insult to this Roukanken.

Youmu:
Yet again... 
I cut something boring.

Remilia:
Sutras? Prayers? Mantras? I don't really understand, 
but it's just idle chatter.

Remilia:
Humans are so... weak. 
I'm beginning to pity you.

Remilia:
I feel like I've asked you to do many things, but...

Remilia:
Those dolls...
They're all controlled by strings? 
Really? Teach me how next time.

Remilia:
You really don't exercise much, do you? 
You're going to get fat.

Remilia:
Can you please explain why a doorguard 
is in a place like this?

Remilia:
You're too weak, how boring.

Remilia:
I only used 1/10th of my strength. 
Just now.

Remilia:
Useless, useless, useless. 
I don't have time to let you win.

Yuyuko:
I've been thinking... 
you have the makings of a good ghost.

Yuyuko:
I've been thinking... 
you don't seem to have a very long lifespan.

Yuyuko:
I've been thinking... 
you're probably going to become a mean aunt.

Yuyuko:
I've been thinking... 
you're like Gulliver.

Yuyuko:
I've been thinking... 
you're like a morning glory.

Yuyuko:
Oh my, if it isn't Youmu. 
Have you finished sweeping the grounds?

Yuyuko:
I've been thinking... 
you're like an umbrella.

Yuyuko:
Hey, Yukari... Have you had a couple screws loose 
in your head lately?

Yuyuko:
Speaking of which... 
I've picked up thin green planks with your name 
on them. Are those yours?

Yuyuko:
I've been thinking... 
you're quite plain.

Yuyuko:
Ah~, that was horrible. 
Another round?

Yuyuko:
It'll... take a while before you can 
fight with your feet off the ground.

Yuyuko:
You know why they call ghosts ghosts? 
...Right.

Suika:
Where were you? 
If you don't feel like fighting, it's not fun.

Suika:
Humans are so helpless. 
I could win with only my ring finger.

Suika:
Your knives are full of holes. 
Next time, I'll show you what real density is.

Suika:
Strength in numbers. Such a small army couldn't possibly 
stand up to my phantom hordes.

Suika:
Your artificial nature... 
will never be able to stand up to real nature. A large thing will serve for a small one.

Suika:
Cutting things? Why are you doing something so slow? 
How many times do you need to cut before a mountain becomes sand?

Suika:
No matter how fast you move, it's useless. 
You'll always be on Buddha's palm.

Suika:
Emptiness, huh? You still have worldly thoughts in your head. 
You'll never reach nirvana this way.

Suika:
Your worldly thoughts...
You have to get rid of them yourself 
or you'll never reach Nirvana. 
First you'll have to fire your manager.

Suika:
What's wrong today? 
You're not your usual self.

Suika:
Your chi can't beat my chi. 
I AM chi.

Suika:
I'll stop here. 
To be honest, I don't actually know when to stop.

Suika:
Sorry, sorry. 
I drank too much.

Suika:
To be honest... 
I feel like I'm picking on a weakling.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing iron sandals? 
So you don't float away.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing a cork? 
So magic doesn't leak out.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing a hammer? 
To strike stone bridges.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing accessories? 
To look more youkai-like.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing vitamins? 
So you can become healthy.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing fun? 
In order to become sharper.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing a sunbath? 
So you won't be as pale.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing-- 
Wait, you should know that even if I don't tell you.

Yukari:
Ah...
What I'm missing are probably enemies? 
Since everyone loves me so much.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing calcium? 
So you can grow taller.

Yukari:
Ah... Maybe you're missing clear water? 
To get the red out.

Yukari:
Shooting, cutting, stabbing, hitting, killing... 
It's all useless against me.

Yukari:
Gensokyo accepts everything. 
And that's a cruel, cruel thing.

Yukari:
I'll tell you a secret. 
...I don't have any weaknesses.

Meiling:
With you, I don't feel like I've won...

Meiling:
You're not allowed past this point. 
Come on, go home, go home.

Meiling:
It's really bad for my health 
to stop you all the time...

Meiling:
It's common knowledge to apprehend trespassers...
but how hard should I punish a repeat offender?

Meiling:
See, I'm not slacking, I'm patrolling... 
Really~

Meiling:
It's rare to see you outside, isn't it? 
I'll keep watch while you're away.

Meiling:
Owwww... My lady, if you're going out, 
shoudn't you take Sakuya with you?

Meiling:
I'm a door guard, so ambushing me isn't good enough.

Meiling:
Well, I didn't think I'd win that easily.

Meiling:
Geez, please remember my name~

Reimu:
Look, there's nothing out here!

Yukari:
The night's still only just begun. No need to hurry.

Reimu:
You've got no room to say "no need to hurry" when you're the one who dragged me out here in a hurry.
You owe me big for this, so don't you forget it.

???:
You've been saying "nothing here" for a while now... I'm here, aren't I!?

Yukari:
Don't worry about it...
I'll pay you back. It's not like I'm you.

Wriggle:
Hey, hey, hey.
You've got some guts, ignoring me.
I hope you've got the determination to match that!

Reimu:
Was that a pun?

Yukari:
Was it?

Reimu:
That reminds me, I forgot something important for an evening stroll. Back at the shrine.

Wriggle:
?

Yukari:
I know what you're trying to say. A mosquito coil, right?

Wriggle:
I'm a firefly!

Yukari:
Really, it's awful at night with all these bugs around.

Reimu:
Says the one who's only awake at night.

Yukari:
Yes, because nature thrives during the night.

Reimu:
There've been lots of fireflies, lately... Kinda makes me worry a little about the outside world.

Yukari:
You understand, don't you? It's not like you to worry, though.

???:
W-waaaait~!

Reimu:
What?

???:
I thought you were some foolishly-tasty humans, at long last.

Mystia:
Who exactly would you two be~?

Yukari:
Um, non-humans.

Mystia:
Non-humans?

Reimu:
Well, human or not, I'm fine either way.

Mystia:
My, that's rare. Seeing non-humans go along this road.

Yukari:
Hmm. You seem to be a night sparrow.
You shouldn't attack just humans so often~.
There won't be any more left around here.

Reimu:
That might be so, how about attacking youkai instead of humans?

Mystia:
Oh, never mind. Besides, human forms haven't been seen on night roads for a long time.
If there's anyone here at all, it'd be non-humans who were in a big hurry, or had some important reason to be here.

Yukari:
Listen. I'll say this once more. We are non-humans, in a hurry, with an important reason.
We don't have time to waste here. Will you let us pass?

Reimu:
The end of this road isn't a place where youkai like Yukari often visit, though...

Mystia:
Aw, even though you're playmates after so long...
I know. How about we go to the village and mess with the humans together?

Reimu:
Ahh, geeze, I've said this before, haven't I!?

Yukari:
?

Mystia:
??

Reimu:
I can see in the dark.

Mystia:
Ah, human sighted.
I'll make you night-blind!

Yukari:
Goodness, it was only a night sparrow.
It's hopelessly too early for her to be acting like a king of bird lice.

Reimu:
...was that really a sparrow just now? It was dark, and I couldn't see well.

Yukari:
If you see a small bird at night, it's usually a night sparrow.
If you don't treat them with caution, you'll become unable to see in dark places.

Reimu:
(...is that really what sparrows are like? Although I couldn't see it well.)
Ah, I can see the Human Village. I didn't really want to come here with you, though...

???:
Is it you? Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

Reimu:
This horrible scene is your doing, isn't it? Where did you send the humans and their village?

???:
I won't hand the humans over to you youkai.
I'll make this night never have happened!

???:
Aah, what the heck are you?

Reimu:
Hey, put the village back!

???:
So persistent.

Reimu:
You don't matter right now.
The Human Village was supposed to be here, right?
But there's nothing here now. What happened to the humans and their houses and everything!?

???:
Nothing.

Keine:
I just made it so that the village was invisible to your kind.

Yukari:
Reimu, we don't have time to stick around here.
The moon is gradually sinking lower as we speak.

Reimu:
We're not exactly sticking, but hold on.
It's not like I can just ignore a youkai that erased a whole village of humans.

Keine:
"Humans never settled here in the first place."
All I did was make it look that way.
I'll protect the humans from this ill-omened night.

Yukari:
Hey, hey.
I can see the humans just like usual, though.
Trickery of this level isn't useful at all, 
is it?

Keine:
! Really, what ARE you two?

Reimu:
Don't worry. They're invisible enough to me.

Keine:
Uu. Your pity isn't helping.

Yukari:
And you.
You're a half-beast, right?

Keine:
I'm human when the moon isn't full.

Yukari:
Not much different from a human-faced dog or human-faced rock, then.

Keine:
Why are you assuming everything but my face changes?! I'll have you know the transformation is full-body!

Yukari:
Or it's like Gozu and Mezu, where only the head turns into a beast's.

Keine:
...oh well.
If you're going to say that, I won't let you take it back.

Keine:
Tonight, I'll make an imperial feast out of your history!

Yukari:
Myself aside, this one's history would amount 
to some light snacks at best.

Reimu:
Shut up. Even then, that means every day is tea and snacks for me.

Reimu:
Now, restore the Human Village!

Yukari:
It'll be okay to put it back. We weren't thinking anything of you and the humans here to begin with.

Keine:
Then, where are you trying to go?

Reimu:
That way.

Yukari:
This way.

Keine:
......
If you're after the ones behind the recent unusual moon, they're that way.

Reimu:
See, I was right, wasn't I!

Yukari:
Reimu, your finger is off from hers by 70 degrees.

Reimu:
You're off by 110‚Äî wait, she figured out what we're trying to do?

Yukari:
It'd be more strange if she hadn't figured it out.

???:
Move and I'll shoot!

Marisa:
I messed up. I mean, shoot and I'll move. Right away.

Reimu:
What? Why are you in a place like this, Marisa?

Marisa:
Well, eh, I'm just hunting some troublesome youkai, 
like usual.

Reimu:
Hey, what a coincidence. I'm doing some troublesome youkai hunting too.

Marisa:
What I'm saying is "hunting troublesome youkai". In your case, it's troublesome "youkai hunting," isn't it?

Reimu:
Not really.

Yukari:
My, I wonder what you can do all by yourself on a night like this.

Marisa:
Hunt troublesome youkai.
I'm already tired of staring at today's moon. It's about time to make it be tomorrow.

Yukari:
So, who's the troublesome youkai?

Marisa:
You. You messed with the boundary of night and day again, right?

Reimu:
We're the ones who're stopping the night. But now isn't the time for that!

Yukari:
Indeed. Don't you have eyes on the back of your head?

Marisa:
Ahh?

Reimu:
Well, she probably doesn't. That's how it is.

Marisa:
Speak Japanese. This is Gensokyo.

Reimu:
Looks like nothing we say will get through to her.

Yukari:
But that distorted moon is so dangerous...

Reimu:
It's not really harmful to humans.

Marisa:
Ahh? I don't know what's happening, but a never-ending night has harmful written all over it.
Youkai eat humans during the night.
If the night keeps going, the youkai will stuff themselves until they drop dead.

Yukari:
There's no way we'd do that.

Marisa:
Gotta exterminate them before they drop dead.

Reimu:
Ah, running away?

Yukari:
Now, let's chase her to the ends of the earth.

Marisa:
Oh, if it isn't Reimu! What's up?

Reimu:
There's such a thing as too barefaced of a lie.

Marisa:
That last one was for Yukari. This one's for you!

Reimu:
Looks like we arrived at our destination while we were chasing Marisa.

Yukari:
You really are lucky. I wish you could share that luck with my Ran, too.

Marisa:
Damnit. What on earth are you two on about?

Yukari:
Thanks to you, we know who the culprit is. You weren't useless.

Reimu:
Well, we haven't figured out the culprit. But at any rate, they're in that mansion.

Marisa:
Well, I lost, so there ain't much I can do. Time to head home an' sleep.
I hope it'll be morning when I wake up.

Yukari:
Sleep for all eternity.

Reimu:
Well, try not to catch a cold.

???:
You're too late.

???:
I've sealed all the doors. You can't take the princess away now, can you?

Reimu:
Is she the culprit?

Yukari:
Who knows. Shall we take her down, first of all? The culprit should be here somewhere.

Reisen:
What, are you youkai?
You shouldn't have been able to find your way here, though. Nothing to worry about.

Reimu:
Hey, I'm still human.

Reisen:
Humans are even less worrisome.

Yukari:
Why would you be worried, I wonder? All this is your mischief.

Reisen:
Mischief? Nnn, you mean sealing up the earth?

Reimu:
Maybe? I don't quite get it, though.

Yukari:
We mean the full moon. I don't quite get it either, though.

Reisen:
Ah, you're talking about the moon? That's my master Eirin's most powerful spell.
It makes this Earth into a giant, sealed chamber. Do you get it now?

Reimu:
There's no way we get it.

Eirin:
Mm-mm. Humans can't understand with an explanation like that.
Also, about that full moon-erasing spell. It's hardly my most powerful one.

Yukari:
Reimu. She's the culprit. I can smell it.

Reimu:
Is she? My intuition is, sort of...

Yukari:
Now, return this distorted moon to normal!

Eirin:
...It's still too early for that. There's no way I can undo this spell yet.
Udonge. Conflict and insanity are all your job, correct?
I'll leave this to you.

Reisen:
Leave it to me. I won't let a single one of those closed doors be opened.

Reimu:
Running won't stop us. We'll get her anyway after taking you down.

Yukari:
Looks like it. It also looks like taking you down won't bring back the full moon, either.

Reisen:
Hmph. I haven't had anyone to fight with lately, so this is just about perfect.

Reisen:
I'll show you two everything of the moon's insanity!

Reimu:
The moon's insanity?

Reisen:
It's my hypnosis, that drove the humans who came to the moon insane. Those humans were weak.

Yukari:
This person. She seems dangerous.

Reisen:
The moon drives people mad.
So, I wonder if you can remain in your right mind while gazing into the eyes of this lunar rabbit?

Reimu:
Okay, now let's go chase that other one down.

Yukari:
But which door did they enter? There are so many, I can't tell.

Reisen:
"That other one"... hey, don't just call my master something like that.

Reimu:
The culprit is down this way.

Yukari:
We've got to capture her before she commits suicide.

Reisen:
She wouldn't commit suicide, and don't call her a...

Reimu:
Shush, you rabbit. Keep it up and we'll tear off your skin.

Reimu:
Okay, now let's go chase that other one down.

Yukari:
But which door did they enter? There are so many, I can't tell.

Reimu:
Yukari. Look, that door over there...

Reisen:
Oh no! I didn't finish sealing them in time.

Yukari:
Is the culprit in there?

Reimu:
My intuition says so. Let's go.

Reisen:
Ohh, my master will be mad at me...

Eirin:
Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

Yukari:
This corridor is strange. It can't possibly be this long.

Reimu:
The outside's turned into some world I've never seen!

Reimu:
It looks like that long corridor has ended now. How about giving up soon?

Eirin:
Ahahaha. My, aren't you two stupid.

Yukari:
Hey, she just said we were stupid. It's because I let a shrine maiden do her things.

Eirin:
The morning will come soon.
After that, I'll return the full moon to you.

Reimu:
My, aren't you a good listener?

Eirin:
My spell is already complete.
It's impossible for anyone to take the princess from here.

Yukari:
A princess?
We had no interest in a princess to begin with.

Reimu:
We only want you to return the full moon.

Eirin:
Don't worry. When morning comes, 
I'll give it right back.

Reimu:
That's not good enough.
We came here to get the moon back 
before the morning.

Eirin:
You're so impatient.
But, look at the place we're in right now. 
Do you know where this is?

Reimu:
??

Eirin:
This place is between the false moon and the Earth.
That endless corridor just now was a false passage that connects the two.
You two were fooled by an illusion that the false full moon produced, and came here.

Reimu:
And? So what about it?

Eirin:
Do you have any method of returning home?

Yukari:
I see. Let's take care of that after beating you.
We're in no hurry.

Eirin:
How can someone who was so perfectly deceived by my spell think they can still oppose me? It's quite strange.
Well, I'm no demon myself.
Until morning, I'll play with you.

Reimu:
I don't quite get it, but...
If we defeat her, it'll solve everything?

Yukari:
See, that's why she called you stupid.
But you're exactly right.
Everything Reimu Hakurei says is entirely correct.

Eirin:
Right now, all Earthlings will wander forever, without ever reaching the moon.
And the people of the moon are just the same.
With this, none of the moon's people should be able to reach the Earth.
This is one of my greatest secret spells. The Earth has become a gigantic sealed chamber.

Yukari:
She's just like that rabbit from before. There's so many lunatics in here.

Reimu:
So, Yukari. Let's beat her up quick, and head back to the Earth.

Eirin:
Oh, it looks like you want to play with me now.
I'm afraid I lack the power to play forever, but...
Even so, I can play until morning.

Yukari:
I wouldn't mind playing forever. But, some other time...

Eirin:
Now, the dawn of Gensokyo is at hand!

???:
What are you playing at!?

???:
Eirin, I grant you one more chance with my power.
If you lose this time...
You there, human and youkai!
With the medicine made by my power, and Eirin's true strength, 
you'll never forget this as long as you live!

Eirin:
Geez.
I told her not to let them come this way.

Yukari:
Reimu. Do you understand what she just said?

Reimu:
Yeah. We're heading the right way, aren't we?

Yukari:
The full moon, after so long...

???:
Yes, this is the true full moon, as seen from the Earth.
More importantly, a human and a youkai... Some very strange guests have come today.

Yukari:
You... What exactly are you?

Kaguya:
I am Kaguya.
You should have offered your names first, though, but I'll let it pass.

Yukari:
It's childish to pass off something like that as an act of kindness.

Kaguya:
Who said I was doing that?
Recently, Eirin hasn't let me out of the mansion at all.
So, the odd guests like you are most welcomed.

Reimu:
SHOT guests?

Yukari:
Don't talk like you're obsessed with danmaku shooters.

Kaguya:
The human body houses a fragile soul.
What those humans live on, is this huge orb below.
And, what the superior people live on...
Is that lunatic orb behind me.

Yukari:
Well, it looks like what we'll be dodging

Reimu:
are some beautiful bullets, as well.

Kaguya:
Don't steal people's lines. My kindness has limits.

Reimu:
Look, we get where this speech is going without you saying it, so it's fine.
We're shot guests, right?

Kaguya:
You two are just so impatient.
Even without hurrying, I'll show you...
The miasma of the true moon! And, my beautiful impossible requests, as well!

Yukari:
You've really got too much free time... Were you just waiting for someone to play with?

Kaguya:
Hey, don't be such a wet blanket~.
I've been hiding here up until now, so I didn't have much chance to go out and play.
But, I'll make up for that today.

Reimu:
Well, it's fine, I guess. It looks like the full moon's already restored and all.
All we have to do now is punish the culprit and set things right for good.

Kaguya:
I'm afraid you can't see the true full moon from anywhere but here.

Reimu:
Whaaaat!?
...is not something that that warrants saying. We'll punish you anyway.

Kaguya:
Well then, are you ready?

Yukari:
Not at all.

Reimu:
Not at all.

Kaguya:
My five requests that so many humans in the past have failed to complete...

Kaguya:
How many of them can you fulfill?

Kaguya:
What the!?
I see. The ones who are stopping the night...
It's you two, isn't it.

Kaguya:
This half-finished eternal night that you have made...
With my spell to manipulate eternity, I'll tear it all away.
The dawn shall be upon us soon.
How's that? With this, your spell of eternal night shall be broken, and the dawn shall come!

Marisa:
Ah, the moon sure is beautiful tonight.

Alice:
What? Does it seriously look like that to you?

Marisa:
Hmph. It's beautiful, isn't it? What do ya call a moon like this? The matsuyoi?

Alice:
I envy your carefree manner. 
If I could have enjoyed moon watching, and hadn't been short of hands...
I'd never have taken you with me tonight.

???:
It's a waste not to enjoy a moonlit night, isn't it?

Wriggle:
Right? You two?

Marisa:
Totally enjoying it. 'Least, I am.

Alice:
Well, I'm enjoying myself, too! 
At least more than you, Marisa.

Wriggle:
Didn't you just say something completely different?

Alice:
Of course not. What I'm enjoying isn't the moon-watching, it's the--

Marisa:
Firefly-watching, right?

Alice:
Almost, but not quite. Very perceptive of you, though.

Wriggle:
...If you don't come, I will!

Alice:
It's more like firefly-HUNTING.

Marisa:
You realize firefly-hunting is about catching them, not beating them up, right?

Alice:
I wanted to catch it, but you went and squished it!

Marisa:
Geez, this is lame...
Don't get me wrong‚Äî‚Äî all I did was dodge it.

???:
Wait, waaaait!

Marisa:
Huh?

Mystia:
Where are you going this late at night?

Marisa:
It's my annual Youkai Extermination Month. I'll go wherever youkai live.

Mystia:
Wait, what? Are you picking a fight with me?

Alice:
Marisa is just a type of person who exterminates youkai repeatedly.

Marisa:
Oh? Don't you know how awesome I am at that?
After I've fired my magicannon, there are no humans left, let alone youkai.

Mystia:
You, human...
Don't you have any idea who I am?

Marisa:
Huh?

Mystia:
There's no human that doesn't fear me on night roads.
If I wanted, I could call enough youkai here to eradicate every human in this land.

Alice:
...hmph. What does this night sparrow think she's saying?

Marisa:
Hahaha~
Looks like you still don't get who I am.

Alice:
Human?

Mystia:
Human.

Alice:
Human all the way.

Marisa:
Er, well.

Mystia:
All right? Starting tonight, you two...
Will never again see in the dark.

Marisa:
Ah, I can see clearly. I can do just fine in any darkness.

Alice:
For goodness' sake! We've got no time to waste on such small fry!

Marisa:
But where are we heading, anyway? There's no way there are any enemies in that direction.

Alice:
I feel a strange air from over this way, though.

Marisa:
There's only humans over that way. All innocent, much like m'self.

???:
Is it you? Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

Marisa:
Nahhh. We're just passing by. Don't mind us.

???:
Hmph, I won't trust the words of a youkai.
I'll make this night never have happened!

Keine:
What the heck are you?

Marisa:
By that you mean, "Whoops, I gotta be somewhere else," right?

???:
I can't retreat any further now, as I expected.

Marisa:
Now, are you gonna surrender the humans to us?

Alice:
Wait, wait, Marisa!
Who said we were gonna eat the humans?

Keine:
Hmph. To think that youkai would come as far as this village.
Is it because of that abnormal moon, after all? They've only come here rarely before.

Marisa:
Nobody's saying we're gonna eat them.

Alice:
Anyway. I'm in a real hurry!
I don't know who you are, but we don't have time to waste for any humans.

Marisa:
You're mean.

Keine:
If you were just quietly passing by, I wouldn't try to stop you.
But you two are being just a little too noisy.

Alice:
See, she called you noisy, Marisa.
That's because you're going all-out with your magic even though it's the dead of night.

Marisa:
What are you sayin'? Magic's something you've gotta cut loose with at night, y'know?
The only things worth using secretly in the day are cyanotypes and stuff like that.

Keine:
I felt an unpleasant feeling approaching, so I sealed the village...
Seems I was right to do that.

Marisa:
I TOLD you.
Nobody's saying we're gonna attack the humans.

Alice:
(...Didn't you just say "surrender the humans to us"?)

Marisa:
Really, the only human I'm concerned with is you!

Keine:
Whatever you say, you dirty liar.

Keine:
I won't let a single one of your danmaku touch the humans or history of this village!

Alice:
Marisa!
I'm quite sure you haven't noticed yet, but she isn't human.
She's a half-beast.

Marisa:
A half-beast that can't transform without the full moon is just some human, really.

Alice:
You know you're a human too, right?

Keine:
If only it'd been a full moon tonight, I could've...

Alice:
Oh, yeah. We're trying to restore that full moon.

Marisa:
Yeah. We said that to begin with, right?

Keine:
Ahh? What the? I never heard that.

Alice:
It seems to me like you know who's responsible for this.

Marisa:
Now, since I've won, you'll keep your promise and tell us who it is.
The promise being one we made just now.

???:
Freeze!

Reimu:
Just as I thought that it was strange that the night still hadn't ended...
So it was you, Marisa.

Marisa:
Oi, you've got it wrong. The only bad one is this person here.

Alice:
What!? You're guilty of the same thing, aren't you, Marisa?

Reimu:
Doing something like this... What on earth are you two plotting?

Marisa:
That's, um, y'see. Reimu, how do I put this...?

Alice:
Why the stuttering? Just yell at her like you always do.
"You! Get outta my way!" Like that.

Marisa:
Moron! It'll get ugly if she gets mad.

Reimu:
Making me mad to begin with is what's ugly, right?
I'll definitely have to teach you a bit of a lesson tonight.

Alice:
Hmph. Will you still think nothing's wrong when you look behind you?
The distorted moon is already that obvious, isn't it!?

Reimu:
Ahh!
This moon is your doing too, huh?

Marisa:
Okay, fine. I give up.
You're right. The endless night, that broken, warped moon,
hiding the human village, and putting hats on the stone statues; 
all of it was Alice's fault.
Now, get outta my way!

Reimu:
Well, all right.
In this bamboo forest bathed in moonlight,
you two will become one of the shining bamboo trees. How beautiful.

Alice:
Allow me to return those words, albeit a bit differently.

Reimu:
C'mon! This endless night will end right here!

Marisa:
Oh? It's not like her to retreat.

Alice:
Chase her down, Marisa.

Reimu:
Now, I'll show you two my true boundary.

Marisa:
What's the point of squaring off with us again?

Reimu:
There's two of you, so I get two tries!

Marisa:
A'ight, let's get moving.

Alice:
Our destination is now in sight.

Reimu:
Well, there's not much I can do. Don't take your evil plotting too far.

Alice:
Did you say something?

Marisa:
Man. I never knew there was such a big mansion in the bamboo forest.

Reimu:
Eh? Oh, me neither.

Alice:
Bye bye, now. It's time for the good girl and loser to go home.

Marisa:
Reimu, it's an eternal 'skip one turn' for you. See ya later.

???:
You're too late.

???:
I've sealed all the doors. You can't take the princess away now, can you?

Marisa:
Woah. That corridor was so long and dark, Alice.

Alice:
How about we deal with her, to begin with? That one in front of us.

Reisen:
Hey, what? You two are... people of the earth, aren't you?
What are you up to at this time of night?

Marisa:
It'd take an entire day of wiping to clean a hall that long, no matter how good a janitor you were.

Alice:
I think it'd still be much faster and easier than cleaning your house, Marisa.
--okay, now, come on. Let's deal with her, hm?

Reisen:
Looks like some weirdos have already snuck in.
We're busy right now. If you have no business other than burglary, leave now.

Marisa:
The only ones who'd be busy at this time of night are the ones who aren't living honestly.
right, colleague?

Alice:
Since Marisa will never get to the point, I will.
You or your cohorts are responsible for this warped-moon incident, right?

Reisen:
Indeed.

Marisa:
So, will you return the moon quietly now, or return it after we give you some trouble?
Take your pick!

Alice:
Hey, don't just take all my cool lines.

Eirin:
There's no way we can return that moon yet.
Even as we speak, our relations with the Moon's people are worsening still.
At this rate, there is no way for our princess to escape other than by making the Earth into a huge sealed chamber.

Marisa:
What? Who're you?

Alice:
Marisa, watch out. That person's power isn't like anything I've felt before...

Eirin:
It looks like the two of you are using a copy of an ancient power.
A chaotic power, from the time before humans were around. Those were the days.
I wonder if special powers should be patentable.
Well, before anything else-- Udonge, I'll leave this to you.
Whatever you do, do not let them take our princess.

Reisen:
Leave it to me. I won't let a single one of those closed doors be opened.

Marisa:
Whaaat? Chattering away like that, and then just running away...
It's like she's saying, "hey, come beat me up later".

Alice:
She certainly is. But whether or not we do that depends on...
...whether she's the culprit behind this incident or not. If we forget about that, it'll be morning.

Reisen:
You two are ignoring me too much.

Reisen:
You see? This hypnotic corridor is one of my traps.
Since you two can't fly straight, you'll be completely wiped away by my power!

Alice:
That should be Marisa's line.
You'll be completely wiped away by her magicannon, you hogweed.

Marisa:
Hey, don't take my cool lines.

Reisen:
I wonder if you'll still be able to say that after gazing into the eyes of this lunar rabbit?

Marisa:
Did the moon return to normal?

Alice:
No, she wasn't the one. It must've been that other one...

Reisen:
I may have lost, but do you really think you can oppose my master?

Alice:
There's no way we'll lose.

Marisa:
She looked pretty dinky to me.

Reisen:
I'll admit I wasn't strong enough this time...
But my master has the greatest brain of anyone on the entire moon.
There's no way she'd ever lose to fools like the two of you.

Marisa:
Wha? Using your brain for danmaku? Are you dumb or something? Danmaku's all about power.

Alice:
Comments like that are why people think you're dumb. Danmaku is all about brains. It's just common sense.

Marisa:
Did the moon return to normal?

Alice:
No, she wasn't the one. Hey, check that out...

Marisa:
I get you. That door's open a little bit. The strange air in there is the strongest I've ever felt.

Reisen:
Ahh, that's--

Alice:
Where they keep the gunpowder?

Marisa:
Where they keep the gunpowder.

Alice:
Nowhere else for us to go, then. Since it's the gunpowder of the one who caused this incident.

Marisa:
Right you are. Once we head over there, that gunpowder will solve everything.

Reisen:
Aww, my master's going to get mad at me...

Eirin:
Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

Alice:
Marisa! Shoot her!

Marisa:
Yeesh, you don't hafta tell me twice.

Marisa:
You just keep poppin' out and runnin' off again. Impatient, aren't you?

Eirin:
Impatient? My, aren't you two stupid.
Have you still not realized how far I've led you astray?

Alice:
Marisa, look around!

Marisa:
I'm lookin'. We wound up outside at some point.

Eirin:
Yes, the outside. You were led through that eternal corridor, and came here.
So, how's the air outside?

Marisa:
Which is to say, there IS air outside. Outside the Earth.

Alice:
Marisa! This is strange. That moon, and those stars...

Marisa:
You've just been saying "Marisa! Marisa!" for a while now. Can't you do anything by yourself?

Eirin:
Hahaha. And thus, the humans who depart for the moon are led to this false moon.
The passage between the Earth and the moon has been severed, by my hand.
With this, you Earthlings will never reach the moon.
And the people of the moon will never find the princess.

Marisa:
Princess? Oh, so you're moon people?

Alice:
What makes you think that?

Marisa:
When people go crazy, it's usually because of the moon. That's all.

Eirin:
The princess, myself and Reisen certainly came from the moon.
But, we can't go back there now. Not since a long time ago.

Marisa:
It doesn't really matter to us whether you go back or not.
Haven't you moon people considered those who like looking at the moon?

Eirin:
Well, about that...
If the Earth's people only looked at it, there would be no problem, but...
There were also foolish Earthlings who deliberately came all the way to the moon,
and in the end, stuck a flag on it as if it were their own.
That's why Earthlings have always been, are now, and will forever be inferior.

Alice:
Hmph. We never did such a thing.
There are people on Earth who'll suffer without the full moon's presence, too.
Didn't you think they'd retaliate if you stole the full moon from that Earth?

Eirin:
Oh, that's fine. My spell is already complete, you see.
Once morning comes, we'll give you back your full moon. Of course, it's always really been ours, anyway.

Marisa:
Oh, a'ight.
So, that means all that's left is the retaliation you get for having hidden it up until now.

Alice:
Yeah. Now, how badly should we beat her up?

Eirin:
My, my, I don't want to be hurt.
Unfortunately for you, though I happen to know a bit about medicine, so some minor injuries won't be a problem.

Marisa:
That's pretty convenient. Can we ask you to fix up our nutrition as well?

Eirin:
And, by the way, medicine can be used to attack, too!

???:
What are you doing!?

???:
Eirin, I grant you one more chance with my power.
If you lose this time...
You there, you stray cats!
With the medicine made by my power, and Eirin's true strength, 
you'll never forget this as long as you live!

Eirin:
Geez.
I told her not to let them come this way.

Marisa:
Wha? I didn't know that.

Alice:
Feels like we're headed in the right direction.

Marisa:
Hey, it's the full moon.

???:
Yes, it's quite simply the full moon.
A true magic power that you've all gazed at for hundreds, no, thousands of years.

Alice:
Marisa, that full moon is dangerous.

Marisa:
The moon's dangerous? Are ya half-asleep, sayin' that?

Alice:
Perhaps you can't see them yourself, but...
There are a ridiculous number of full-moon-beams falling on us now.

???:
Don't call it weird names!

Kaguya:
Now, the original power of the moon has been revived.
This moon with no impurity throws its pale light upon an Earth with no impurity...
This light is an ancient memory, forgotten even by the superior people of the moon.

Marisa:
In short, they're full-moon-beams. I can't see them, but I can feel them slappin' down on me.

Alice:
At this rate, ordinary humans would go insane in less than 5 minutes.
Are you okay, Marisa?

Marisa:
Ah, I'm used to being insane.
But what's up with all this, anyhow?
Why's there a full moon now?

Kaguya:
Thanks to Eirin's spell, the pure moon and the pure Earth have been isolated.
By staying here, it seems I can hide myself from both the Earth and the moon.

Marisa:
That's some pretty huge hide-and-seek.

Kaguya:
But...
While this spell of Eirin's is perfect, I don't really like it.
There's nobody else here. Nobody visits, either.
I'm bored to death.

Alice:
An Earth with no impurity has nobody on it.
That's a very Lunarian-esque mentality.

Marisa:
Isn't this good timing?
You can play with this impure pair here as much as ya want, and then we'll take you away.

Kaguya:
Well, since I wasn't born here,
it'll be quite the challenge for you to get me out.
...I remember having another exchange like this, long, long ago.

Marisa:
Eh, I don't really care about the full moon,
but this girl here won't stop throwin' a fit over it being gone.

Alice:
I'm not just throwing some fit.
If you keep messing around too much, divine punishment will fall upon you.

Kaguya:
Divine punishment? That doesn't sound good.
My stay on Earth is already a divine punishment as well, though.
I know. Whenever someone came to take me away, I gave them an impossible request.

Marisa:
An impossible request?
You mean if we fulfill it, we can take you out of here?

Kaguya:
My five requests that so many humans in the past have failed to complete...

Kaguya:
How many of them can you fulfill?

Kaguya:
What the!?
I see. The ones who are stopping the night...
It's you two, isn't it.

Kaguya:
This half-finished eternal night that you have made...
With my spell to manipulate eternity, I'll tear it all away.
The dawn shall be upon us soon.
How's that? With this, your spell of eternal night shall be broken, and the dawn shall come!

Remilia:
Sakuya, I didn't really ask you to tag along.

Sakuya:
What are you saying? I'm simply worried.
If that bug we saw before shows up again...

???:
Say "if she shows up," and I'll show up right away!

Wriggle:
And now, I've showed up. How about you hand that young lady over!

Sakuya:
"If she shows up"... bugs are such poor things, aren't they?
They say a half-inch bug has only one-tenth an inch of soul.

Remilia:
That's 80% smaller.

Wriggle:
Is that supposed to sound frightening?

Sakuya:
No, it just sounds cruel.

Remilia:
Very well, then. I have no interest in non-humans, you see.

Sakuya:
The fact that you're not interested is what's worrying me.
Humans might get away with simply being food, but things lower than them...
*sigh*. There's such a thing as being too merciless.

Wriggle:
Eeeek!

Sakuya:
Ahh. The fireflies have been more numerous too, lately. It's beautiful.

Remilia:
Sakuya, that exclamation mark doesn't match what you're saying.

Sakuya:
I changed the subject partway through, Milady.

Remilia:
I only heard the second half. What were you trying to say?

???:
Wait, waaaait!

Sakuya:
We're in a hurry. If you can keep up with us, we'll listen.

???:
So you won't stop even if I ask. A human and a bat, though? That's an unusual pair.

Mystia:
But humans are what I'm after. I don't need bats.

Remilia:
Hmph. Is it the brats' night out?

Mystia:
Naturally! The good little children went to bed at noon.
At night, it's happy hour for man-hunting!

Remilia:
Too bad we're in a hurry. So, mind getting shot down right now?

Mystia:
W-wait! I said "wait" already, didn't I?

Sakuya:
Milady.
If you start fights even with enemies of this level, there'll be no end to them.

Remilia:
True.

Mystia:
Oh, quit joking around!
Aren't you scared by birds flying in the night?

Remilia:
Birds frying in the night? Humans are better, really.

Sakuya:
(What's better?) Milady, you can't turn "fly" into "fry".

Mystia:
Whatever. I'll show you the true terror of darkness!

Sakuya:
"Terror of darkness", huh...?

Remilia:
Now, Sakuya. Which shall we do: to fry that bird, or to continue on ahead?

Sakuya:
Let's leave the frying for later and proceed onwards. The night is short.
Speaking of which, why are we headed in this direction?

Remilia:
Hm? Refueling.

Sakuya:
......

???:
Is it you? Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

Sakuya:
Milady. Let's pass by this place, and quickly.

Remilia:
Well, I guess I'm not that hungry right now...

???:
Good grief. Without the humans from the village,
the only ones left here are youkai and the weird humans!

???:
Mmph. What the heck are you?

Remilia:
Bah. There's no end to this now, is there?

Sakuya:
Milady! You're toying with her a little too much.

Keine:
Look around, you devils.

Sakuya:
Devils plural, huh?

Keine:
There's nothing here. You can see that, can't you?

Sakuya:
Hey, shouldn't the Human Village be here?

Remilia:
Ah. I rarely visit the place myself, but do you come here often, Sakuya?

Sakuya:
Yes. Many of the tools we use at our mansion were made by the humans here, too.

Keine:
Look closely... As you can see, there was never anything here.
Okay? Move along, now.

Sakuya:
What a bad attitude you have.
What did you do with the village and its humans?

Keine:
Don't you get it? I made it so there were no humans to begin with.
Right now, all of this village's history is under my protection.

Remilia:
Sakuya.
Wouldn't she be a good tutor for my little sister? Teaching her about the local history, or some such.

Sakuya:
We don't need any more bookworms at the mansion...

Keine:
Fine. I'll say it one more time.
There never was anything here from the start. No humans, nor their village.

Sakuya:
Something about what you're saying sticks out to me.
Milady. May I have a bit of time?

Remilia:
We're in a hurry. An incredible hurry.

Keine:
May I have a bit of that devil's history, myself?

Remilia:
Hmph, you're rather full of yourself. Even though you're a were-hakutaku.
All you do is look back at history. Your fate won't be changed.

Sakuya:
Milady. May I please have a bit of time?

Remilia:
Oh, it can't be helped. You may use a bit of my time. Just a moment's worth.

Sakuya:
Ah, that was refreshing. Now, let's move on.

Remilia:
You're feeling refreshed, even though the village hasn't been put back yet?

Sakuya:
Yes, quite so. I feel not one whit of fatigue.

Remilia:
Well, okay. Thanks to her, though, I've completely lost the direction that the strange air was coming from.
Do you know where to go, Sakuya?

Sakuya:
Not one whit. But, look! We have someone who'd be very useful at a time like this.

Keine:
Wha? You mean the cause of this full-moon incident?
It could only be their doing. There are few people capable of such a thing.

Sakuya:
My, bookworms can be useful. Although we certainly don't need any more.

Remilia:
Our mansion's bookworm really is a bookworm, so she's hardly any use at all...

Sakuya:
We have quite enough useless knowledge already. We don't need any more.

???:
Stop right there!

Reimu:
So it was you, after all.
No wonder I thought the flow of time was weird.

Sakuya:
What are you talking about?

Remilia:
Look, you're always doing something weird, right? That's Sakuya for you.

Sakuya:
Oh, how cruel of you.

Reimu:
Well, you're pretty much always doing something weird, but today you've gone much too far.

Reimu:
This is just like when you made that scarlet mist.

Remilia:
Sakuya is doing something weird, but we're not the ones who're doing the biggest thing right now.

Sakuya:
We're on our way to teach that culprit a lesson right now.

Reimu:
Maybe you could fool a bird with that excuse, but you can't trick me.
Whenever you two move, time stops, and the night gets longer.
You two are the culprits who are stopping the night!

Remilia:
Well, yeah. Anything wrong with that?

Sakuya:
Milady. Stopping the night is not our goal right now.
Look at the moon behind Reimu, please. See, it's already so...

Reimu:
That moon's got nothing to do with this unending night, doesn't it?
The night's stopped, and a vampire is running rampant because of it.
What could be more dangerous than that!?

Remilia:
I'm already queen of the night, so at least forgive that.

Sakuya:
I don't think you're helping...

Reimu:
Anyway, I'm going to have you return the passage of time to normal right here.
Exterminating youkai like you is my job!

Sakuya:
You still don't understand why we're stopping the night yet, it seems.

Remilia:
Sakuya, there's no need to hurry here.
As long as you're adjusting the time, at least. I don't mind her misunderstanding, either.
This is my chance to pay her back for that day.

Sakuya:
Well, if you say so, Milady...

Reimu:
So, are you ready to go back to your coffin?

Remilia:
I told you before that coffins are for the dead, didn't I?

Reimu:
That scarlet, dark and windowless coffin!

Remilia:
She's fleeing! This way.

Sakuya:
Do you think you can escape from my knives?

Reimu:
How are you not getting lost in this bamboo forest...?

Sakuya:
We're just following you. You can't escape.

Reimu:
I was just surprised before, since you both attacked at once. Now, I'm ready.
Fall into the gap of my boundary!

Remilia:
I've paid you back.
I'll do you a favor and won't drink your blood, so go on home.

Reimu:
Mmm. What on earth was your goal in stopping the night?

Sakuya:
You should have asked that before we fought.
We've won now, so there's no need for us to give an answer.

Remilia:
...restoring the eternal full moon... (mumbling)

Sakuya:
Not eternal!

Reimu:
I'm not gonna like it if it's still night tomorrow.

Remilia:
Sakuya, look. That mansion...

???:
You're too late.

???:
I've sealed all the doors. You can't take the princess away now, can you?

Sakuya:
Is this moon incident your doing, perhaps?

Remilia:
She looks shifty. Especially with that defiant appearance.

Reisen:
Ah, less so than you, winged one.
At any rate, what business do you have here in the middle of this night?

Sakuya:
Important business. This moon incident is because of you or an acquaintance, isn't it?
They say that if there's a bad smell, clean up its source.
I'm good at cleaning.

Reisen:
Moon incident? Mmm, it looks like you've noticed our spell.
Even though you're just impure people who only crawl around on the Earth.

Remilia:
Unfortunately for you, I'm a filthy creature who only watches the moon and stars in the sky.
I know when the moon changes, for good or for bad.

Sakuya:
You're quite the night person, Milady.

Remilia:
Restore the full moon to Earth, right now.

Reisen:
There's no way we can undo this spell yet.

Eirin:
My, I thought they just came to pick her up,
but it's just some lost youkai?
Well, there shouldn't be anyone picking her up anyway.

Sakuya:
Who're you?

Remilia:
Sakuya, she's the villain. You can tell with one glance at that villainous face.

Eirin:
What a cruel thing to say.
I certainly did create this sealed chamber around the Earth.
But, it was for the sake of the princess and this girl.

Sakuya:
If that's the case, there's no way we can leave until we've beaten you.

Eirin:
Mmm, but that's still no use. Udonge, I'll leave this to you.
Whatever you do, do not let them take our princess.

Reisen:
Leave it to me. I won't let a single one of those closed doors be opened.

Sakuya:
I've found that no matter what happens, there's always a path to follow.

Remilia:
What a pain. As usual, you're not going off the beaten path, Sakuya?

Sakuya:
Just stick to the regular path, and overwhelm the enemy. That's the trick to avoiding complaints.

Reisen:
Hahaha. The path to follow is the one behind you.
But, there's no turning back now.

Remilia:
We won't be turning back.

Reisen:
Don't you see that you've already fallen into this moon rabbit's trap?
Left, right, up and down... Your sense of direction has already gone insane.
Though you're trying to fly straight ahead, you're floating around aimlessly.
Now, gaze into my eyes, and become more insane still!

Sakuya:
Milady, let's proceed along the regular path. We'll be at the exit soon.

Remilia:
Sakuya, the one we saw before is down this way. But, um...
We ought to be careful. I think we'll be fine, though, since I'm with you.

Reisen:
My master's power is beyond comparison to me.
You may have beaten me, but do you think you're a match for my master?

Remilia:
Overwhelmingly.

Sakuya:
Now, let's finish this before dawn comes.

Reisen:
I see. So it was you two who were lengthing the night.
I assumed that she......

Sakuya:
?

Sakuya:
Milady, let's proceed along the regular path. We'll be at the exit soon.

Remilia:
Sakuya, the one we saw before is down this way. But, before that...
Let's go through that door over there.

Sakuya:
What's over there?

Reisen:
Ahh, crap. There was a door that I didn't have time to seal yet?

Remilia:
The one we seek is down that way.
My eyes can't be deceived.

Reisen:
Ohh, my master will be mad at me...

Eirin:
Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

Remilia:
Hey, hey. Is there no end to this?

Sakuya:
We've gone so far by now, but... I can't see an end to this corridor!

Sakuya:
It looks like the corridor has ended, but where on earth is this...?

Eirin:
That's enough.
Haven't you realized yet, after coming so far?

Remilia:
Damnit! We fell for it, Sakuya.
That's not the moon!

Sakuya:
Certainly, it is a little on the large side.

Remilia:
Well, that's because we're closer to it, I guess.

Eirin:
Yes, you were led through that eternal corridor, and came to this false moon here.
The full moon is the one key that links the moon to the earth.
If one were to break that key, travel between the moon and earth would be impossible.
See? You've been deceived by this fake illusion, just like that.

Sakuya:
Ah, it's an illusion. Was that absurdly long corridor just now an illusion too?

Remilia:
It might've been.
No cleaning mop would stand a chance against a corridor that long.

Sakuya:
Well, wouldn't you need a wet rag and not a mop? That'd hurt your back.

Eirin:
That's a very pointless thing to worry about, isn't it? It's an illusion. An illusion.

Remilia:
That aside, what's the purpose of these convoluted things you're doing?
Nobody's trying to go to the moon.

Eirin:
There are many fools outside of Gensokyo who are heading to the moon, though...
More importantly, my only intention right now is to protect the princess from the moon's pursuers.
If dawn arrives, with things as they are, no more messengers should arrive from the moon.

Sakuya:
Ah, so the reason there were so many rabbits back there is because they were moon rabbits.

Eirin:
No, most of those were caught on Earth.
Only Reisen, who you saw just now, is a genuine moon rabbit.

Remilia:
Who cares?
It's fine if we just know who stole the full moon. Their reason doesn't matter.
All we've been thinking about until now is how badly we're gonna beat the culprit when we find them.
Sakuya, don't go easy on her.

Sakuya:
I haven't gone easy on any enemies up until now.

Remilia:
...so, let's fight to the death.

Sakuya:
I won't die.

Eirin:
You're quite composed.
I lured you out here so I could play to my heart's content.
There's no need to worry. Once it's morning, I'll return your full moon, you see.
All that's left is to play until then.

Sakuya:
What a relief, Milady.
Whether we win or lose, the full moon will be restored.

Remilia:
Are you going soft?
We have to get her back for disrespecting me, or I won't be able to keep my dignity in Gensokyo.
The full moon doesn't matter by now.

Eirin:
Hmph, what a brat.
Young children like yourself can't stand a chance against me, an eternal being.
All the scarlet history that you've built up---
Divided by my history, the result is zero. From eternity's point of view, you are but a mere instant.

Sakuya:
Look, Milady. You should respect the elderly.

Remilia:
You're the youngest one here.

Eirin:
Also, it was you who was stopping the night, yes?
You may very well incur the princess's wrath for doing that...

Remilia:
So, you ought to respect me, Sakuya. As much as you like.

Eirin:
And they aren't listening.
This is why youngsters nowadays are such a bother.

Eirin:
I think you'll find this medicinal barrage more important than your chatter!

???:
What are you playing at!?

???:
Eirin, I grant you one more chance with my power.
If you lose this time...
You devils there!
With the medicine made by my power, and Eirin's true strength, 
you'll never forget this as long as you live!

Eirin:
Geez.
I told her not to let them come this way.

Remilia:
Sakuya. This one's a decoy.

Sakuya:
Well then, let's shoot her down at once.

Sakuya:
Milady. Are there any injuries on you?

???:
There will be.

Remilia:
None at all.
---hey, who're you?

Kaguya:
Defeating Reisen and Eirin, and coming so far...
It wouldn't be fair if you didn't have at least one injury.

Remilia:
Too bad. I'm invincible on the night of the full moon.

Sakuya:
First I've heard of that.
---hey, the full moon appeared at some point, Milady.

Remilia:
I knew that. That's why I said it.

Kaguya:
This is the true full moon.
I wonder when it was that this full moon vanished from the earth,
along with its power to drive people insane.

Remilia:
This full moon is...
Sakuya! Watch out!

Kaguya:
Yes, this true full moon will drive mad any human who looks directly at it.

Sakuya:
Well, I feel fine, though?

Remilia:
...I guess you'd be okay, Sakuya. You're very well-disciplined.
Well, even without Sakuya, I'm still invincible under this full moon.

Sakuya:
Ah, isn't that a bit cruel?
I will help you no matter what the situation. Please rely on me.

Remilia:
Oh my, Sakuya, are you starting to go a little insane?

Kaguya:
The moon granted many powers to the Earth.
Most powers such as magic were originally those of the moon.
Your companions include people who depend on the moon as well, don't they, miss vampire?

Remilia:
So what?

Sakuya.:
It's a full moon right now. That means we're invincible. Wonderful.

Kaguya:
Heh heh.
We of the moon turned some on the Earth into monsters, to regulate the Earthlings' impurity.
But, that's all over now.
The Earthlings have sealed the monsters by themselves.
Now, all that's left of them are creatures who don't know how to do anything but attack humans as part of some old contract.

Remilia:
Our current daily life of drinking tea is much more enjoyable. I don't see what's wrong with that.

Sakuya:
......

Kaguya:
Gradually, the Earthlings lost their fear of the moon and its night.
They became more and more arrogant.
The night no longer requires the light of the moon.
The shorelines have no relation to the tides' ebb and flow.
And they even say they'll invade the moon itself in the end, don't they?

Remilia:
Hmph. I've got no idea what those worthless humans are doing.
But you're from the moon, right?
Why don't you go back to the moon and fight the Earthlings there?

Kaguya:
I...
have a reason that I can't go back to the moon.
I am not an ally of the moon's people. Nor can I move openly on the Earth.

Sakuya:
You can't go back to the moon, and you have no place on Earth.
You must've done something quite terrible.

Kaguya:
I've been trying to avoid bothering the Earthlings, and avoid meeting with powerless people.

Sakuya:
An invincible lady and an invincible human.
Would you like to test that claim that we're powerless?

Kaguya:
My five requests that so many humans in the past have failed to complete...

Kaguya:
I wonder if you can clear them?

Kaguya:
What the!?
I see. The ones who are stopping the night...
It's you two, isn't it.

Kaguya:
This half-finished eternal night that you have made...
With my spell to manipulate eternity, I'll tear it all away.
The dawn shall be upon us soon.
How's that? With this, your spell of eternal night shall be broken, and the dawn shall come!

Youmu:
You, show yourself! The wriggling one, hiding in the darkness there.

Yuyuko:
Youmu, don't leave me behind here...

Youmu:
What are you saying? The night is very short!
We have to find the villains quickly, and cut them into mash.

Yuyuko:
No, I didn't mean...

???:
"Cut them into mash"...

Wriggle:
Are you cutting them or mashing them? Make up your mind!

Youmu:
Now, before you get cut or mashed, tell us which direction we ought to be going!

Yuyuko:
Youmu, save the excitement for when dawn is nearing!
I told you not to leave me behind, didn't I? 
The night's only just started.

Wriggle:
What is with these two?

Yuyuko:
Oh? There's a big firefly in front of us.

Youmu:
Did you not notice her yet...?

Yuyuko:
Firefly watching is quite nice, too. Youmu, would you like to take a side trip?

Youmu:
Do we really have time for that now!? I'll slice this bug to ribbons with my Roukanken...

Wriggle:
You're spending the most time just talking like this!
It's been such a long time since I've seen anyone who wouldn't be pleased to see fireflies!

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko, it takes a while for you to defeat enemies because you don't focus your aim enough.

Yuyuko:
My, haven't you ever heard the saying, "haste makes waste"?

Youmu:
Ah, yes, we are in a hurry. So, where should we go next?

Yuyuko:
Well? How about we see which way this branch falls?

Youmu:
Is that really okay...?
Wait, with the way you're holding that, there's really only one direction it'll fall.

Yuyuko:
Round and round and round it goes~

???:
Wait, waaaait!

Youmu:
You're in the way.

???:
The two of you aren't hearing my song, are you?

Mystia:
Perhaps you're not human?

Yuyuko:
It's nighttime, but I hear a sparrow calling. Youmu?

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko, please don't get distracted by this song.
That's the cry of a night sparrow. It's one of the most accursed sounds in the world.

Mystia:
Accursed? How rude of you.
At the very least, my singing is better than the sound of approaching phantoms, isn't it?

Yuyuko:
Yes, indeed. It's no contest at all.

Youmu:
Please don't agree with her...

Yuyuko:
Youmu, listen! The cries got louder again. I wonder where they're coming from.

Mystia:
Geeze. Whether you are human or you were human, it doesn't matter to me.
Now, the fun youkai festival begins.

Yuyuko:
Okay, Youmu. Shall we hurry along?

Youmu:
Huh? Er, yes. I suppose we should, yes. But we've got to shoot down this bird in front of us, first off.

Yuyuko:
I don't like sparrows. They're too bony.

Mystia:
You shall not pass!

Youmu:
That night sparrow's appearance is going to attract lots of youkai and other things, before long.
Let's move on before that happens. We have to hurry.

Yuyuko:
Hang on. Got a bone in my throat...

Youmu:
Didn't you just say you didn't like sparrows?

Yuyuko:
It's not good to be a picky eater, Youmu.

???:
Is it you? Are you the ones trying to attack the village in the middle of this night?

Yuyuko:
Oh? It seems we've gotten lost in some strange place.

Youmu:
Yeah, where are we...?

???:
There's no point in plating innocent. I can tell you're ominous ghosts.

??/:
Crap! These ghosts are really something.

Yuyuko:
Oh, how cruel. Treating ghosts like outcasts, really.

???:
What business do you have in some place like this?

Yuyuko:
You attacked us before, right? We're just going to respond to that.

Keine:
There is nothing here. Just move along already.

Youmu:
It's easy to say that, but we really don't know where we're moving to...

Keine:
Are you just wandering around with no goal?

Yuyuko:
No, no, Youmu.
We're certainly heading in the right direction. All you need to do is go where I tell you to.

Keine:
What is your purpose?

Youmu:
To restore this abnormal moon to normal.

Yuyuko:
No, no, Youmu.

Youmu:
!?

Yuyuko:
We're having our fill of a wonderful nighttime sightseeing tour.

Keine:
You two are really way too suspicious.
Although phantoms are suspicious at the best of times.

Youmu:
Wait, I can't just let you say that. Phantoms aren't suspicious.

Yuyuko:
No, no‚Äî

Youmu:
Shut up.

Keine:
...you two really do seem dangerous. Looks like I'll have to drive you away from here.
Although I don't quite get what you're doing.

Yuyuko:
Hey, hey, Youmu.
So far, we've had a bug, a bird, and now a beast.

Youmu:
What are you trying to say?

Keine:
Hmph. I'll help myself to all of your history!

Keine:
Every last bit. Even from before you became phantoms.

Yuyuko:
I wonder if a dragon's up next.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko. Please concentrate on what's happening now, and not what's going to happen next.

Youmu:
"Beast"? Please, milady, you shouldn't treat humans like beasts.

Yuyuko:
No, no, Youmu.
This girl appears human right now, but she's a half-beast. Kind of like you.
Although, I think humans are beasts too, so I guess she's a full beast?

Keine:
Damnit. If the moon hadn't been incomplete, I'd never have lost to such phantoms...

Youmu:
Oh, yes, yes. We've got to take back the full moon.

Yuyuko:
Now, next up is a dragon dish. I can't wait, Youmu.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko, you said you knew where our destination was, right?
Somehow, I feel kind of concerned.

Yuyuko:
A dragon would have lots of scales, though.

???:
Move and I'll shoot!

Marisa:
I messed up. I mean, shoot and I'll move.. Right away.

Youmu:
What? That's strange, running into you in a place like this.

Marisa:
Well, eh, I'm just hunting some troublesome youkai, like usual.

Youmu:
Disturbing? Do you know who's doing all this, then?

Yuyuko:
I'm telling you, even ordinary people could understand that.

Marisa:
Well, then, I understand. How could I not, when the ones gathering up this strange air are flying right at me?
Tomorrow's the harvest moon-viewing that we've been waiting for. I already got bored of staring at tonight's moon.

Yuyuko:
Oh, you don't seem to understand.
We're the ones who are stopping the night.

Marisa:
Yeah, and?
That's why I came here to kick your butts, ain't it?

Youmu:
Hey, you. The black-clothed one. Don't you feel anything when you look at that warped moon behind you?

Marisa:
Didn't I just say I got bored of lookin' at it?

Youmu:
You can't look away from reality.
While we're arguing like this, that moon is sinking lower.
Don't you understand that things will get really bad if we just leave it be?

Marisa:
Ehh? An endless night will cause far more trouble for sure.
For instance, the bamboo here will grow eternally if the night lasts too long.
Might even reach the moon, perhaps.

Yuyuko:
The nail that sticks out gets struck down. Oh? How would you move if you get struck down?

Marisa:
Yeah, I'll move, all right. I'll keep on moving until dawn breaks.

:
Lady Yuyuko, she's fled. Shall we pursue?

Yuyuko:
What a bother. I mean, we're headed that way too, but...

Marisa:
Okay. You shot, I moved. Now, the real battle starts here.

Youmu:
You're still up for this? The game's already decided, isn't it?

Marisa:
Hmph. There's two of you, so I get two tries!

Youmu:
That was such an awful waste of time.

Yuyuko:
For phantoms, there's no such thing as wasted time. Everything is going as planned.

Marisa:
Damnit. What the heck are you two saying?

Yuyuko:
An instant is everything. Everything is but an instant. The time we spent playing with you was inevitable, too.

Youmu:
Huh? I see a huge mansion in the middle of the bamboo forest.

Yuyuko:
Youmu. Didn't I say it'd be strange to not understand what's happening?
Inside there... is the dragon dish I've been searching for.

???:
You're too late.

???:
I've sealed all the doors. You can't take the princess away now, can you?

Youmu:
Looks like we've finally found the culprit.

Yuyuko:
This is just a space bird. We're far from done, so don't get worked up.

Reisen:
Huh, some phantoms? Don't get me all worked up, geeze.
If you've got no business here, leave. We're in the middle of something right now.

Youmu:
No way. This moon incident was caused by you, wasn't it?
If so, I'll slash you. If not, I'll slash you and move on.

Reisen:
Moon incident? Ah, you mean the earth-sealing spell?

Yuyuko:
Right. This spell of yours is incredibly troublesome.
We'll have you put a stop to it this instant. Now, Youmu, go slash her.

Youmu:
Um, er, here I go?

Reisen:
What rowdy phantoms. Aren't you going to listen to us for even a little bit?

Eirin:
My, I thought we had guests, but it's just some phantoms?
Well, there shouldn't be any guests arriving anyway.

Yuyuko:
Youmu, there's another one. Slash her too.

Youmu:
H-huh? Should I go?

Eirin:
Oh, look, you shouldn't tease the poor girl like that.
The business with the moon is due to my spell. But, it was for the sake of the princess and this girl.
Even phantoms ought to have at least this much kindness in them.

Youmu:
So you're the culprit? I've got one less person to slash, then.

Eirin:
Mmm, but don't get all worked up yet. Udonge, I'll leave this to you.

Reisen:
Leave it to me. There's no slashing going on, but I won't let a single one of those doors be opened.

Youmu:
(Huh, there isn't there much difference between that lady and Lady Yuyuko.)

Yuyuko:
The brain has left, and the bird remains. Youmu, you've got one less person to slash.

Youmu:
Huh? Er, slashing. Will do.

Reisen:
Heh heh heh. You've only been thinking of the moon...
Don't you see that you've already fallen into my trap?

Youmu:
!?

Reisen:
Your sense of direction is starting to go insane. You're already unable to fly straight!

Youmu:
Speaking of which, Lady Yuyuko, why'd you call her a bird? She looks like a rabbit...

Yuyuko:
When skinned and eaten, they're the same thing. Remember that.

Reisen:
Hey, don't tell lies. ...and don't ignore me!
I doubt you'll be able to remain sane after gazing into my eyes!

Youmu:
Ohh, my head is spinning. I'm starting to feel sort of gross...

Yuyuko:
My, my, your human half got sick just from being shaken around that much.
Well, don't fret. Next, we'll eat something that's good for your health.

Reisen:
I can't believe this. You're far stronger than I thought...

Yuyuko:
Next up, herbal dishes. And that's the end of it, too.
Unfortunately, it's not a dragon after all, though.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko. Do you know something I don't?

Yuyuko:
Not at all.

Youmu:
Ohh, my head is spinning. I'm starting to feel sort of gross...

Yuyuko:
My, my, your human half got sick just from being shaken around that much.
How about we go through that door over there and rest for a little a bit?

Reisen:
Ahh, crap. There was a door that I didn't have time to seal yet?

Youmu:
No, I'm okay. Let's hurry ahead and chase that one from before.

Yuyuko:
You sure? The door that's open is the door to enter.
Our final course is surely waiting for us in there.
Well, it might not be much of a respite, though.

Eirin:
Hahaha.
Good, so you're following me.

Yuyuko:
We've caught up with you. You won't be escaping now.

Youmu:
Yes, you won't be escaping.

Youmu:
Ummm. Where'd she go?

Eirin:
Here, here.
You really are half-baked. You lost sight of me in such a short time.

Yuyuko:
What are you doing? What's that big phantom half of yours there for?

Youmu:
Not for chasing people, surely.

Eirin:
Well, this is a false pathway I created.
So it's no wonder that you lost track of me.

Youmu:
False pathway?

Yuyuko:
A false moon in a false sky.
You're really overdoing it with this.

Eirin:
Ah, impressive. You see that this moon is an illusion.

Yuyuko:
That's a very old moon. One from when the moon was still there in the heavens.

Youmu:
Old?

Yuyuko:
A terribly old-fashioned moon, with mold growing on it.
The moon these days has no rabbits on its surface.

Eirin:
Well, no, there are rabbits there even now.
The people and rabbits of the moon have been living quietly on the far side.
Unseen, protected by a barrier... Yes, it's much like your Gensokyo.

Youmu:
A Gensokyo on the moon?

Eirin:
And so, this illusory moon is a memory of the past moon.
That's why it looks so old-fashioned.

Youmu:
So, what are you trying to do by dragging this musty old moon out?

Eirin:
My task is already coming to an end.
The full moon is the one key that links the moon to the earth.
Just by removing that, no pursuers can reach the Earth's surface from the moon.
Even now, they're pursuing us to a fake Earth. To an old, musty Earth, yes.

Yuyuko:
In short, you are a criminal.
Those who try to escape from something are those who've committed a crime.
Those who try to hide themselves are those who've admitted their crime.
And criminals who've admitted to a crime always start making excuses.

Youmu:
......

Eirin:
No, it's not like that.
This may be a bit unreasonable, but I simply didn't want to go back to the moon because it was comfortable here.
There's no need to worry. Once it's morning, I'll return your full moon, you see.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko, give me some instructions.

Yuyuko:
Oh, have you understood what I was saying by now?
Well then, first, please become my shield.

Youmu:
Leave it to me. I will be the hardest shield in all the Netherworld.

Yuyuko:
Seeing as I'll back you up if I feel like it.

Eirin:
Ahahaha.
A shield can only stop something from the outside.
We of the moon have the ability to use more internal forces.
While you're becoming a hard shield, the soft parts inside you are slowly rotting...
Yes, you carefree girl over there. A "hard shield" is meaningless.

Yuyuko:
Don't worry, Youmu. I'm not alive, so I can't rot.

Youmu:
I understand. You're rotting to begin with, right?
But rotten or not, it's the Konpaku family's duty to protect you.

Yuyuko:
I said I can't rot.

Eirin:
I wonder how long that attitude of yours will last.
This ceaselessly overflowing memory of the moon...
Amongst the Earthlings bathed in it, there are none who didn't go insane.

Yuyuko:
Looks like there's no helping it. Youmu, keep this one thing in mind so you don't go insane.

Eirin:
Ah, you're a phantom and not a human. I guess you won't rot, then?

Yuyuko:
Things are most delicious when they're about to rot.

Youmu:
Why are you telling me that now...?

Eirin:
Well said. However, fermentation is a power granted by the gods.

Eirin:
You ghosts, unable to rot, have been forsaken even by the gods!

???:
What are you playing at!?

???:
Eirin, I grant you one more chance with my power.
If you lose this time...
You ghosts there!
With the medicine made by my power, and Eirin's true strength, 
you'll never forget this as long as you live!

Eirin:
Geez.
I told her not to let them come this way.

Yuyuko:
Youmu. Press on.

Youmu:
Yes. Pressing on now.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko, look. What an amazing full moon.

???:
This is the true full moon.
It seems that you two are neither human nor youkai.
I wonder why you've wandered into such a place as this?

Yuyuko:
Youmu.
Looking at that moon is a fearful thing.
Stop looking at it, right away.

Youmu:
Er, wha, is it really?

Kaguya:
The true moon is fearful, indeed.
That's something that the Earthlings have long since forgotten.
You must be quite the nostalgic human.
Or rather, ex-human?

Yuyuko:
Every now and then I still think of myself that way.
This girl is still half-human, though.
It'd be quite bad if half of her went insane.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko. If I look away from the moon, I can't see her either!

Yuyuko:
Look at her with your mind's eye.
What's that big phantom half of yours there for?

Youmu:
Not for using any inner eyes, surely.

Kaguya:
What fun.
You're neither impure humans, nor youkai.
You truly have nothing, it's quite enjoyable to look at.

Youmu:
Oh no, Lady Yuyuko! It's completely dark when I close my eyes!

Kaguya:
Wouldn't it be okay to look at this full moon and go insane, just a little bit?

Yuyuko:
You can still slash things without looking at them, can't you?

Kaguya:
So, what are you doing here tonight? What business do you phantoms have?

Yuyuko:
If even a little bit of a sphere is missing, it loses its value.
That's because it can't stay round forever.
But, as that flawed sphere is rolled around a bit, it becomes a full sphere once again.
That's what this is about, isn't it?

Youmu:
Ahh, when I open my eyes all of a sudden, the light is blinding me.

Kaguya:
Yes, that is indeed what eternity is about. The peaceful world.
Actually, I'm able to manipulate eternity.

Yuyuko:
‚Äîso, does that mean you're the one who's stopping the night?

Youmu:
Huh? Lady Yuyuko, isn't that...?

Kaguya:
I could never do something so cruel.
Trust me on that one.

Yuyuko:
Well, that doesn't matter to me anyway.
I'll be satisfied if we can return the full moon to Gensokyo.
Morning will still come in the meantime.

Youmu:
Well said.

Yuyuko:
Youmu, this is your final order.
Slash the eternity before your eyes.

Kaguya:
Oh, eternity is still eternity, even with pieces missing. You were saying that just a minute ago, weren't you?

Youmu:
Okay, so I'll slash her with my Hakurouken here!

Yuyuko:
I said this just a minute ago, but she has to be the one who's stopping the night. Surely.

Youmu:
No, um, I think that's...

Kaguya:
Wrong. I said that, didn't I?
Well, whatever. You're so eager to fight with me, so shall we begin?
My five requests that so many humans in the past have failed to complete...

Kaguya:
How many of them can you fulfill?

Kaguya:
What the!?
I see. The ones who are stopping the night...
It's you two, isn't it.

Kaguya:
This half-finished eternal night that you have made...
With my spell to manipulate eternity, I'll tear it all away.
The dawn shall be upon us soon.
How's that? With this, your spell of eternal night shall be broken, and the dawn shall come!

Keine:
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

Reimu:
Are you the "guts" in this trial of guts?

Keine:
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

Reimu:
I wonder what that was about. 
It does feel like the fairies are pretty rowdy tonight...

???:
The moon tonight is especially strong.
It's no wonder that all the creatures are rowdy, really.

???:
So there are even fools who'd go out on a night like this, huh?

Reimu:
Who's that?

???:
You, obviously?

Reimu:
No, I'm not asking who's a fool.

Yukari:
So you're admitting to being a fool too, then.

Mokou:
I'm a human who's lived here for a long time. 
I'm not here because I'm a fool.

Yukari:
A human? 
A human, huh.

Reimu:
Maybe she owns the forest or something.

Mokou:
So, what are you doing here, fools?

Reimu:
A trial of guts.

Yukari:
And of various other things.

Mokou:
What! A trial of guts!?
Oh, since when have humans 
been this foolish?
You come all the way out here in the dead of night,
with this lunatic full moon, and tons of youkai out,
for a trial of guts, of all things!?
It's a miracle that you weren't killed by youkai yet.
A trial of guts, seriously! If you die, 
it'll be your guts the youkai will feast on---

Yukari:
She's just babbling. 
Reimu, any counterattacks?

Reimu:
Ehh, well. We're just having this trial of guts 
because Kaguya was saying 'hey, go on out there,' so...

Mokou:
What was that? 
Did you say "Kaguya"?

Reimu:
Um, did I?

Yukari:
You certainly uttered "ka‚Äïgu‚Äïya".

Mokou:
Rrrgh! 
I figured your trial of guts was suspicious.
Of course she'd be behind this.
Yeah, she goaded the two of you into 
getting rid of me this time, didn't she?
She always, ALWAYS tries to 
do away with me!
Argh, and wasn't she the one who gave me 
this inconvenient body in the first place!?

Reimu:
Huh, she's getting all worked up on her own.

Yukari:
See? If you don't take advantage of this, you'll lose.

Mokou:
Hmph. So, how about I see for myself 
just how strong you messengers of Kaguya's are?
If she sent you, you must be 
more powerful than her, right?

Yukari:
How brave. To think that there'd be a human 
brave enough to confront a youkai like me.
I only knew three others like that.

Reimu:
I'd kind of rather not fight 
another human, though...

Yukari:
What are you saying? 
You were fine fighting Marisa, weren't you?

Mokou:
Don't go thinking I'm some ordinary human.
I won't die. I'm completely unable to die. 
Thanks to that lousy Kaguya.
Yes, no matter how hard she tries to eliminate me, 
it won't do her any good at all.
She knows that, and she still sends you messengers. 
This cannot get any more annoying.

Yukari:
Look, Reimu. 
You missed another opportunity.

Reimu:
I still don't quite get it.
But if she won't die, that means 
I can go all-out on her, right?

Yukari:
More or less. Although it looks like the "completely 
unable to die" part is just her being full of herself.

Mokou:
If you don't go all out, 
it's game over for your life.
There's no turning back now. 
It's a one-way street in the dead of night.

Mokou:
Just what you wanted. 
Allow me to test your guts.

Mokou:
Ohhh man. 
You're too strong...

Yukari:
Wow, look, she's still alive. 
She really can't die, huh?

Reimu:
I'm seriously surprised. It looked like 
she was about to die a bunch of times.

Mokou:
Ow, ow! I won't die, but it still hurts~.

Yukari:
Reimu, this girl is quite interesting.

Reimu:
Er, looking at her in pain and saying "that's interesting"
is a bit, uh...

Mokou:
If you're this strong, there's no point 
to a trial of guts, is there?

Yukari:
Really? 
There's still various things that I'm scared of.

Reimu:
Like manju?

Yukari:
Yeah, they're shaped like giant insect eggs. 
And then that jelly inside is like...

Mokou:
Oh noooo. Manju are so scary.

Reimu:
Well, anyway, is our trial of guts finished?

Yukari:
Oh? 
Now that you mention it, we haven't tried any guts yet.

Reimu:
?

Yukari:
See? The human in front of us is full of guts. 
Reimu, you cut out her guts and give them a try.

Mokou:
Eeeek. 
I won't die, but that's scary.

Reimu:
Why on earth should I have to 
do something so youkai-like?

Yukari:
Well, if you eat an immortal person's guts, 
you'll become immortal too.

Reimu:
That said, I'd rather not 
stop being human, y'know...?

Mokou:
Oh, that's mean. Are you saying I'm not human?

Reimu:
Are you human...? 
I don't really know.
Well, in any case, Gensokyo is full of things 
that you can't tell are human or not anyway.
I guess it wouldn't matter much these days 
if the container for your soul is different.

Yukari:
Youkai extermination is the duty of the Hakurei, though. 
Would that be youkai discrimination?

Reimu:
Okay, I take that back. Youkai should be exterminated. 
Humans should do the exterminating.
It's an unshakable contract we have. 
I'll keep exterminating youkai from now on.

Yukari:
Right you are.

Keine:
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

Marisa:
Well, this is a trial of guts.

Keine:
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

Marisa:
It sure is creepy when nothing's happening. 
Absurd, too.

???:
True terror lies beyond the 
fear that you expect.
There's nothing more terrifying than a haunted house 
devoid of people acting as ghosts.

???:
Even night sparrows are silent in the bamboo forest in the dead of night. 
To think that there'd be humans wandering around in here.

Marisa:
Who're you?

Alice:
Marisa, this girl...

Mokou:
I'm a human who's lived here for a long time. 
Don't worry. I won't kidnap you or eat you.

Marisa:
Human? 
Doesn't look like one.

Alice:
Marisa, she definitely looks human... 
but, be careful.

Mokou:
So, what are you doing out this late?

Marisa:
Harvesting bamboo shoots.

Alice:
A trial of guts.

Mokou:
Which of those?

Marisa:
Oughta be obvious...

Mokou:
Beneath the full moon, a human and youkai are on a trial of guts.
Does the human have guts, or is she a fool?
That human over there ought to have guts that are 
pretty stiff and tough to chew.

Marisa:
Are you really human?
Can't say I've seen any humans who're this fond of guts. 
At least, none who're still alive.

Alice:
Does she look alive to you, Marisa?
She looks dead to me. 
Well, maybe she just looks like she's not alive?

Mokou:
Hey, don't treat people like phantoms.
That's almost correct, though. 
You can see through illusions pretty well.

Marisa:
So I guess yer a gut-eater, then?

Mokou:
Actually...
I can't die.
To be devoid of death is to be devoid of life.
Without the unnecessary states of life and death, 
I'm about as close as you can get to a pure human.
So I may be like a phantom, in a certain sense.

Alice:
So she won't die! 
Even if we roast or bake her, too.

Marisa:
How about if we boil or fry her?

Alice:
If a human could reach a state of immortality...
That legendary medicine must really exist. 
It wasn't a lie, after all.

Marisa:
I dunno what you're talking about.
Who the heck would tell you a true story 
and make it sound like a lie?

Mokou:
That medicine? 
You mean the Hourai Elixir?
That old thing. I used it all up 
a long, long time ago.
Certainly, I stole that medicine, 
and am immortal even now.
Kaguya still tries to kill me, 
but it's impossible to do that.
This stupid fight of ours has dragged on for over a thousand years now.

Marisa:
I get it now. 
All of it.
So, you're playing the role of the ghost in this haunted house.
I did think that this whole "trial of guts" thing 
sounded weird when Kaguya brought it up.
I defeated Kaguya, so it follows that I 
could put an end to you.

Alice:
Hey! You're not trying to steal all 
the credit for yourself, are you?
Besides, defeating a human is a job for a youkai. 
The person before us is obviously mine to defeat.

Mokou:
What, Kaguya was defeated? 
By these two in front of me?
How do I say this? To think that such a troublesome 
Lunarian would be done in by a team like this.
It's been a long time since I've had to 
confront such tough assassins.
Or maybe it's just your guts that are tough?

Alice:
It's too bad about that Hourai Elixir. 
I wanted to get my hands on it no matter what.

Marisa:
My guts are totally healthy. Not stiff at all. 
Thus, I don't need any medicine.

Mokou:
The Hourai Elixir is a forbidden medicine 
that should never be consumed by humans.
With a single touch, you will never become an adult. 
With a second touch, you will forget all disease and illness.

Mokou:
With a third touch... 
Your souls will forever churn in torment!

Mokou:
Aw, maaan. 
That was way too tough for me...

Marisa:
Wanna go again? 
Looks like you really can't die.

Alice:
She can't die, sure, but doesn't it look like 
she's running out of stamina?

Mokou:
I already have. I'd better give it a rest 
before my muscle pain tomorrow keeps me from moving.

Alice:
Muscle pain? That's all?

Marisa:
Y'know, I've always wondered. If you divide an immortal 
right down the middle, which half still counts as their body?

Alice:
Why would you always wonder something like that?
Immortality is like casting away the physical body.
Your soul alone is what you actually are, 
and it's able to produce a new body.
Souls don't have a particular size, so they can 
create a new body wherever they like.
Conversely, a body without a soul would perish rather quickly, right?

Mokou:
You sure know an awful lot.
It looked like you really wanted the Hourai Elixir. 
Did you want to become immortal too, or something?

Alice:
Not really. I'm just interested in souls. 
I thought I could use them to make independent dolls.
Besides, that elixir wouldn't even work 
on youkai, would it?

Marisa:
Hey, I got another question.
If souls don't have a particular size, then what's that thing 
that's always stickin' around Youmu?

Alice:
It's a phantom, isn't it? Totally different thing. 
Never mind that, anyway.

Mokou:
As I am undying, phantoms are unliving.
Maybe all that's different is our form. Or guts.

Marisa:
Huh, I see. 
So, how did my trial of guts go?

Mokou:
Oh, well. They're hard and blackish... 
Perhaps it's liver cirrhosis?

Marisa:
Aw, no, have I been drinking that much?

Alice:
Marisa, to cure your guts, you should eat someone else's. 
Plus, an immortal's guts are...

Marisa:
A human's guts would be a bit much, immortality aside.

Mokou:
An immortal's body is immune to all disease, 
so my innards are totally clean.
But don't go eating them.

Marisa:
I'm not gonna... 
Although the whole immortality thing is pretty appealing.

Keine:
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

Sakuya:
My, you've certainly changed.

Keine:
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

Sakuya:
Well, I suppose these attacks are above average, 
but it's not much of a trial of guts.

???:
It's the dead of night, and non-humans are fighting each other.
A brutal night, with neither humans or youkai around.

???:
Maybe that's because it's a full moon tonight?

Sakuya:
Sorry, but I'm human.

Mokou:
Really? 
Sorry to say, though, but I'm human too.

Remilia:
Sakuya, we came at just the right time. 
There's a human, in a place like this.

Sakuya:
Just the right time? 
It's still a bit early for a meal, isn't it?

Mokou:
So, the young lady there is a youkai? 
Although I guess that was obvious from the wings and all.

Remilia:
Don't lump me in with mere youkai. 
I'm proud and noble...

Sakuya:
There's no need to be proud and noble 
at a time like this.

Mokou:
So, what would a human and a youkai 
be doing together here?

Sakuya:
Er, well, we're having a trial of guts...

Mokou:
A trial of guts?
For a human and youkai?
And under the true full moon to boot, in the dead 
of night when only the plants are asleep?

Remilia:
What's wrong with that? We're just enjoying this 
nice, cool breeze a bit out-of-season.
You're a human, so just quiet down and entertain us 
by becoming a monster for our trial.

Sakuya:
Milady. Humans don't become monsters, 
they just act like them.

Mokou:
Aren't there plenty of sinister spirits already?
Why would you need a human to go 
to the trouble of acting like them?

Remilia:
You said you're a human.
Why aren't you afraid of youkai, then?
Why aren't you quaking in fear of me?

Mokou:
Have you come for a "trial of guts", 
or to give someone's guts a try...?
But, I have nothing to be afraid of any more.
No matter how many times I'm pierced 
by arrows too fast to see,
No matter how many times I'm burnt 
by divine fire that can consume a village in a moment,
I cannot die.
I can't test my guts anymore, either.

Sakuya:
This is wonderful, Milady.
You can drink her blood as much as you want. 
No matter how much you drink, she won't die.

Remilia:
It's no good, Sakuya.
She's not human any more. 
I only drink the blood of humans who fear me.

Sakuya:
My, that's too bad. I thought she might be like 
that gourd that produces infinite liquor.

Mokou:
Are you really human?
If you are, forget about your trial and go home already. 
This place isn't somewhere where you should be.

Sakuya:
She was speaking to us like there 
was something here, though.

Remilia:
Oh, it looks to me like there is something here. 
Right now, and slightly in the future.
Your knives are sharp, Sakuya, but your mind's a tad dull.
Kaguya wanted to lead us to this person, so she obviously 
set us up on a trial of guts for that purpose. That has to be it.

Mokou:
Hrm. 
Kaguya, you say?
So that's it. I did think it was strange that a 
human and youkai were having a trial of guts here.
She's always trying to eliminate me. 
She's always sending assassins.
And even though she knows I'll never die!
Kaguya's the one who made the Hourai Elixir, right?
I wish she'd just give this a rest already.

Remilia:
See, Sakuya? 
Kaguya was using us, just like I said.

Sakuya:
Indeed. So you're saying you went along with it 
because it seemed interesting, Milady?

Remilia:
Well, no, to kill time.

Mokou:
The guts of this trial are the smoke of Mount Fuji. 
The eternal volcanic ash, reaching to the moon.
An ever-resurrecting immortal bird, 
born from unextinguishable flames.

Mokou:
A legendary phoenix, growing in strength with each rebirth. 
The bullets of this evening will be the young lady's eternal trauma.

Mokou:
Aw, maaan. 
I can't take any mooore.

Remilia:
Huh? 
Surrendering already? You're all bark and no bite.

Sakuya:
I've had enough already~. 
Please don't taunt a human who can't die.

Remilia:
Oh, yeah. You're a human who can die, Sakuya.

Sakuya:
What an ominous comment. 
Hearing it from Milady, it doesn't sound like a joke.

Mokou:
I may not be dying any time soon, 
but I really can't keep fighting~.

Remilia:
So, how about you become immortal too, Sakuya?
Then we can be together forever.

Sakuya:
I'll be a mortal human as long as I live, thank you.
Don't worry, though. We'll be together as long as I'm alive.

Mokou:
I don't recommend becoming immortal.
They might not look it, but these bruises 
you gave me are really painful.
Although I won't die even if it hurts.

Remilia:
If you say so, Sakuya, there's not much I can do. Shame, though. 
Speaking of that immortal medicine... the Hourai Elixir...
It builds up in an immortal human's guts.
The elixir of immortality stands before us, although 
she's rather beaten and tired right now.

Sakuya:
Who would eat a human's guts?
And who told you that, anyway?
Wait, no, I probably know who it was already.

Mokou:
Talking about eating a person's guts? This is a 
pretty scary conversation you're having.
This isn't my trial of guts, is it?

Remilia:
That's what "a trial of guts" means, right? 
Right, mortal Sakuya?

Sakuya:
You learn such bizarre things when you spend time 
with Lady Patchouli. It's a bit troubling.

Keine:
I've been waiting.
You've got some guts, challenging me on the night of the full moon.

Youmu:
...this may be a trial of guts, but I'm not scared of you!

Keine:
I won't let you lay one finger on that human!

Youmu:
The attacks just... stopped, all of a sudden. 
This is when things are at their scariest.

???:
A phantom, dressed loudly and conspicuously.
And in the dead of night, when even the plants are asleep under the full moon.

???:
Seeing phantoms isn't rare, but your appearance 
definitely stands out.

Youmu:
Wah, someone's there!

Yuyuko:
Youmu, there she is.

Mokou:
Funny for a phantom to be saying that.

Yuyuko:
......

Youmu:
What, a human? 
I was about to slash her by mistake.
...but, wait, a human at this hour? 
That's definitely weird!

Yuyuko:
............

Mokou:
I live around here to begin with. 
Time aside, you two are far more unusual.
So, what business do you have here?

Youmu:
We're here for a trial of... uh, Lady Yuyuko?

Yuyuko:
Youmu, don't get close to her.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko...?

Yuyuko:
That girl is different from other humans.
Don't touch her. 
Her curse will be passed on to you.
Don't eat her. 
Her poison will curse you, too.
Above all else... 
My powers can't affect her.

Mokou:
That's a pretty sour way to talk about someone 
you've only just met.
And what are these "powers", huh? 
What were you trying to do?

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko can invoke death in humans. 
But if it doesn't work on you--

Mokou:
So you tried to take my life right off the bat? 
You're pretty dangerous phantoms.

Youmu:
Aren't you human?
Well, then, I don't understand why 
Lady Yuyuko would be afraid of you.

Mokou:
Unfortunately, yes, I am human. 
I just sort of can't die, is all.

Yuyuko:
A person of Hourai... 
This is scary, Youmu.

Youmu:
You were fine with this trial of guts up 
until now... did you eat something funny?
Well, I'll just do something about this myself.
I would never have thought something could frighten 
the unshakable Lady Yuyuko.

Mokou:
Shouldn't I get along well with phantoms?
This is somehow irritating. 
Maybe I should just start attacking now~?

Youmu:
But what is so frightening about her, 
Lady Yuyuko?

Yuyuko:
A human who has drunk the Hourai Elixir will become unable to age or die.
If another human eats that immortal human's guts,
that person too will never age and never die.
And if a ghost eats them...?
An undying ghost will be born.
Thus, the cycle of Hourai ends. They'll never achieve nirvana 
or reincarnate, and the elixir will stop along with them.
Well, I guess it'd be fine if you didn't eat them.

Youmu:
Then don't eat them!

Mokou:
My god, you're such noisy phantoms.
If I turned into a phantom myself, 
would I be as crazy as you two?
I guess I'll never know, since I won't die.

Youmu:
I was a fool for worrying. 
Lady Yuyuko is Lady Yuyuko, after all.

Yuyuko:
I might still eat them~. 
Those eternally fresh, raw guts look pretty tasty to me.

Youmu:
I'll take care of what your powers can't reach, Lady Yuyuko.

Mokou:
Can the dead really strike the living, in the end?

Youmu:
We may not be able to make you one of us, 
but let's give this a try and see if you really are immortal.

Mokou:
Ghosts who have forgotten nirvana cannot be reborn. 
A human who cannot die will not know the vivid Netherworld.
As one really lives, lives, lives, she doesn't know the start of life. 
As one really dies, dies, dies, she doesn't know the end or death.

Mokou:
As I do not know death, I have surpassed that darkness. 
See this beautiful danmaku, unchained from the dark samsara!

Mokou:
What the?! 
I'm reaching my limit, here...

Youmu:
Even if you're immortal, your body still has its limits.

Yuyuko:
Okay, our opponent can barely move. 
Now!

Youmu:
What do you mean, "now"? 
We're not eating her, right!?

Mokou:
I can't die, but I can't keep fighting like this. 
My body hurts all over.

Yuyuko:
Being a ghost is nice. 
Your body never hurts. What do you say to being one?

Mokou:
Are you even listening to me?

Youmu:
A human that can't die sure is interesting. 
I can use my full power without any hesitation.

Yuyuko:
My, were you holding back the whole time?

Youmu:
Good heavens, no.

Mokou:
That aside, you're very strong. 
Why is that?
I guess everyone's just younger than I am?

Yuyuko:
A human would obviously have limits 
to their strength, wouldn't they?
You can try all you like, but you can't beat a phantom.

Youmu:
I don't think being phantoms had much to do with it, 
but it was rather that there were two of us...

Yuyuko:
Oh, my. There's some eternally fresh, raw guts 
before us. How rare.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko...

Mokou:
Oh, fine.
It hurts too much to move, 
so boil me, roast me, whatever!

Yuyuko:
Boiling or roasting would be no good!
You have to eat the guts raw. 
Boiling or roasting would neutralize the elixir's effect.

Youmu:
Well, then, let's roast her.

Mokou:
Even if you roast me, I won't die. 
It'll just be kind of hot... *sob*

Youmu:
By the way, how did we wind up 
in this situation, again?

Yuyuko:
Didn't you say you wanted to take on 
the trial of guts, and asked me to come along?

Youmu:
Oh, right, that.
So why have you been saying "raw guts" this, 
"raw guts" that for a while now?
I gave up on the trial already. 
I realized it was just Kaguya tricking us.
She obviously just wanted us to fight this human. 
The trial of guts was all a lie.

Yuyuko:
Gave up? You just paused, right? 
The trial of guts starts again from here on.

Youmu:
Uhh... 
Honestly, I'm bad with scary things...

Yuyuko:
Hey, look, there's a phantom under that tree...!

Youmu:
Eeeeek!

Reimu:
At least the lake surface hasn't changed from the normal spring.

???:
She's here, she's here!

Cirno:
Here she comes, just like a what's-it-called to a flame!

Reimu:
It's spring, not summer.

Cirno:
You're supposed to say, "It's ice, not fire!"

Reimu:
I'm fed up with running into nothing but fairies everywhere I go.

Cirno:
Shrine maidens aren't supposed to be wandering around!

Reimu:
So far, this incident has been happening everywhere 
I've been without exception. 
So I guess it doesn't matter where I go.

???:
A duck carries a leek and...

Mystia:
It's coming~ 
Ah~ It's coming~‚ô™

Reimu:
Isn‚Äôt that song inappropriate for a bird to be singing?

Mystia:
A professional isn't picky about what they sing.

Reimu:
When flower viewing, rather than singing songs, 
isn't it more wonderful to compose songs?

Mystia:
So many flowers are blooming. 
You lost for not taking the chance to sing!

Reimu:
Even flying all the way above the clouds... 
There's nothing that can be a hint.

???:
Finally, to the flower incident,

Lyrica:
-the shrine maiden makes her move. 
You're way too late.

Reimu:
I try to work, and this is the thanks I get-- 
Wait, what? You're alone today?

Lyrica:
I'm off today.

Reimu:
And you're wearing that on an off day... 
Even brought along your instrument.

Lyrica:
Even if I'm alone, it's a piece of cake.

Reimu:
I sure lost my lead fast... 
Who the heck would be doing such a thing?

???:
Even the Shrine Maiden~

Tewi:
- seems to be completely at a loss this time!

Reimu:
Even if I don't have a lead, I'll eventually arrive at the truth! 
That's a Shrine Maiden!

Tewi:
That's some confidence. 
Well, meeting me here might not be completely fruitless.

Reimu:
Mind if I take a rabbit's foot with me? 
As a good luck charm.

Tewi:
The way's gonna be pretty long 
if this is all our Shrine Maiden has.

Reimu:
This mansion is so dark all the time.

???:
That's because it only lets in the moonlight.

Reisen:
What brings you here today?

Reimu:
I just thought I'd stop by.

Reisen:
"I'm here to investigate the flower incident," 
is written all over your face!

Reimu:
Really? 
You don't know anything? 
You're no help, 
so call your master for me.

Reisen:
Unfortunately, there's no one here 
who knows about the flowers.

Reimu:
Huh? 
These are normal cherry blossoms.

???:
The abnormality of the flowers haven't reached the afterworld.

Youmu:
That's why it's calm here.

Reimu:
Since flowers are blooming... 
I thought you people might be up to something again.

Youmu:
You're seeing it for yourself. 
You're wrong so go back already.

Reimu:
She's not cracking. 
I really was wrong.

Youmu:
What are you doing? 
If you're a Shrine Maiden, 
then hurry up and find out the truth behind this.

Reimu:
Could it be that even the bamboo flowers are blooming as well?

???:
Those are a rare sight.

Marisa:
But, what we do will remain the same.

Reimu:
You mean flower viewing?

Reimu:
Unlike you, I have an obligation to find the cause.

Marisa:
However pretty the flowers are, 
you can't dodge if you keep looking away.

Reimu:
I can't get rid of the scent of flowers no matter where I go.

???:
That's true,

Sakuya:
which means no shortage of ingredients.

Reimu:
For what?

Sakuya:
Jasmine tea...-like tea.

Reimu:
By the way... 
What's jasmine tea?

Sakuya:
You shouldn't overboil.
The smell will dissipate.

Reimu:
Hmm. 
I honestly don't have a lead... 
At this rate, I'll have to go pretty far out of my way...

???:
That's

Marisa:
pretty damned obvious. 
Did you think sticking around here 
would let you find the culprit sitting there like a rock?

Reimu:
Normally, if I just arbitrarily go fight someone, 
the culprit will show up eventually!

Marisa:
That's not something to brag about, though.

Reimu:
This isn't getting me anywhere. 
I'll go to where I rarely visit next...

Marisa:
Even the great Reimu is at a loss this time.

Reimu:
Hmm. 
I honestly don't have a lead... 
At this rate, I'll have to go where I rarely visit...

???:
You seem quite troubled.

Sakuya:
A rare sight.

Reimu:
Not finding a single clue while 
randomly flying around and fighting... 
This has never happened before.

Sakuya:
You've been over opportunistic. 
With all the, "Flower viewing, flower viewing!"

Reimu:
This isn't getting me anywhere. 
I'll go to where I never really go next...

Sakuya:
This is hypothetical, but... 
I don't think this one incident needs to be resolved.

Reimu:
There was a pond here? 
Well, I rarely visit the mountains... 
Anyway, even the lotus are in full bloom. 
Really, what's going on?

???:
It's been a few hours since any signs of people at the shrine, 
so I thought to myself, "The Shrine Maiden 
has finally made her move!" 
It was tough searching and I couldn't find her, 
so I wondered where she was headed,

???:
And lo, the Shrine Maiden sighted! 
This deep in the mountains!

Aya:
Now then, time for a news story~

Reimu:
And lo, a suspicious youkai sighted.

Aya:
Now now, don't mind me and just continue. 
Go on.

Reimu:
Even if you tell me to continue... 
I haven't a single lead and I'm just flying about. 
I was wondering why so many flowers were blooming, 
and just on that I went out and wandered around.

Aya:
Flowers, you say... 
That doesn't sound like it'll be a news story.

Reimu:
Wait, who are you?

Aya:
That was way too slow... 
I'm your plain ol' newspaper reporter tengu. 
I've written up everyone's interesting behaviors so far. 
That's why we tengu know quite a lot about you people.

Reimu:
Written up? I haven't even seen any 
newspapers recently.

Aya:
Well then, as I've said earlier, don't mind me and continue on. 
I'll be discreetly recording.

Reimu:
Oh yeah. 
I just remembered. 
I was in the middle of a youkai extermination.

Aya:
Huh--

Reimu:
I was in the middle of 
indiscriminately exterminating any youkai I find.

Reimu:
It's your own fault for nonchalantly appearing 
in front of a youkai exterminator.

Aya:
Hmm. 
I would've been better off taking pictures secretly...

Reimu:
Ah, that's right, you're a newspaper reporter? 
Then you're a source of information, no? 
Then tell me everything you know about this flower incident!

Aya:
Ah, yes. Flowers. Right. 
The flowers are self-explanatory. 
Don't you feel that there's something else going on 
aside from the flowers?

Reimu:
I already had a hunch even without being told.

Aya:
Then please don't ask me.

Reimu:
Yes, I can finally see my destination. 
With my intuition.

Aya:
Fighting with me 
won't give me a news or anything.

Reimu:
Yeah.
I was distracted by the amount of flowers, but... 
There are two other things that are abnormally increasing. 
First, the number of fairies... 
Well, I guess they probably just came out to see the flowers.

???:
What is a living human...

Komachi:
Blabbing on about in this graveyard!

Reimu:
And the fact that spirits are everywhere!

Komachi:
A first warning for the human hurrying to their death. 
The fee for crossing Sanzu River is unreasonable. 
You can't cross with just shrine offerings.

Reimu:
I won't be crossing. I've got no money either-- 
Wait, who are you?

Komachi:
I'm the first class Sanzu River guide, 
Komachi of Onozuka. 
At the Higan shores is Sanzu's Titanic. 
I'm talking about my boat, you see. 
I usually don't let living humans cross but... 
If you can pay the fee, I don't mind taking you 
on a luxury cruise across the Higan shores.

Reimu:
I said I won't cross. 
And I don't have money either.

Komachi:
Limited time offer 10% off.

Reimu:
Whatever already! 
I'm just here to investigate the spirits 
that have been multiplying along with the flowers.

Komachi:
Spirits? Flowers? 
Aah, spirits, spirits? 
Spirits are multiplying?

Reimu:
Spirits. I was thrown off by the flowers, 
but upon further inspection, I see now that 
there are spirits everywhere.

Komachi:
Aah, how did this happen!? 
Looking more closely, the red spider lily are blooming too. 
And those purple cherry blossoms... 
Er, um, I'll just pretend I didn't see that.

Reimu:
Don't. 
You look like you know something.

Komachi:
Well, I'll be off here... 
I have work and all, you know.

Reimu:
Could it that... 
You didn't ship the spirits to the Higan shores 
like you were supposed to? 
Is Gensokyo full of spirits, 
becasue you were slacking off?

Komachi:
How am I supposed to gather them all 
and where am I supposed to go~ 
--Well, to Higan, I guess.

Reimu:
Go do your work! 
Stop slacking off all the time!

Komachi:
I got it. 
If you're saying you'll interfere with my work then. 
I'll ferry you over with my Titanic. 
50% off.

Reimu:
Now, take your huge ship and ferry those ghosts!

Komachi:
Even if you defeated me... 
With this many ghosts, 
this is extreme overworking, it's impossible~

Reimu:
Looks like you're a quitter. 
Fine, call your boss for me please!

Komachi:
No, don't do that...

???:
Are you slacking off!? Komachi!

Komachi:
Kyan!

Reimu:
Here comes your boss.

Komachi:
Seems you can't pay even half the price. 
Do you have money on you in the first place?

???:
Komachi didn't bring in any souls after such a long time, 
so I came here to check the situation.... 
The Shigan is full of ghosts and flowers, 
and on top of that, Komachi is fooling around with a Shrine Maiden.

Eiki:
Sigh. When I first met Komachi, 
she seemed like a more diligent person.

Reimu:
You're... that shinigami's boss. 
You people caused the flowers incident, right?

Eiki:
Those nameless spirits haven't realized they're dead. 
They don't want to realize it. 
Such spirits are unstable. 
That's why they desperately want a body. 
Spirits who have lost their place come to dwell in flowers. 
That's why the flowers bloomed. 
Yes, those spirits were humans from the outside. 
The lost spirits of those who died unexpected deaths.

Reimu:
Are you saying that, all these flowers... 
are the humans spirit from the outside world?

Eiki:
Flowers are plants that present one's personality, 
in other words, qualities of one's soul. 
That's why they have a strong affinity with spirits. 
Bright spirits reside in sunflowers, 
Friendless, lonely spirits rest in red spider lily. 
And in the purple cherry blossoms...

Reimu:
I... see. 
It's not that the flowers themselves were doing something, 
but because there are too many spirits without a place, 
this flower incident occurred. 
Well now that I get it, I'm going to need you to 
do something about it. I can't really do much.

Eiki:
Is it? It doesn't bother us, 
and it shouldn't be much of a problem to you either. 
Also, if the ghosts make the flowers bloom, 
they can still believe they are alive... 
I don't think it'd hurt to leave them alone for a while.

Reimu:
That's not the issue here! 
If I leave the incident alone, it'll look like I'm slacking off! 
If I just beat you instead of complaining, 
everything will return to normal, right?

Eiki:
You've exterminated many youkai for no good reason, 
and even some that weren't youkai. 
And despite being a Shrine Maiden, 
you don't commune with your god. 
At times you even oppose your god.

Eiki:
That's right, your karma runs a little too deep.

Reimu:
Hm...

Eiki:
At this rate, if you die you won't even be able to go to hell.

Reimu:
Well, if I can't go to hell, I'll just go to the Netherworld.

Eiki:
A Yama's judgment isn't as lenient as that. 
It is impossible to overturn a decision. 
If I were in charge of judging you, you have sinned.

Reimu:
How rude! 
Exterminating youkai is my job, it can't be helped.

Eiki:
Thieves, assassins and soldiers 
would all say the same thing. 
Just because it's their job, it won't pardon their sins. 
To cleanse your sins even a little, 
you must accomplish good deeds.

Reimu:
All right, 
I'll consider that after defeating you and bringing the flowers back to normal.

Eiki:
In the purple cherry blossoms 
resides humans neck-deep in sin. 
Under these raining purple cherry blossoms, 
you shall cleanse your sins!

Eiki:
Well? Have you learned yet? 
But your sin isn't something as small as this. 
You still must repent much more.

Marisa:
It's already spring, but it's still a bit chilly.

???:
When you eat too much shaved ice~

Cirno:
You'll get a stomach ache~ ...so, what's wrong?

Marisa:
So YOU'RE the reason it's so cold here!

Cirno:
Did you forget to wear your stomach warmer?

Marisa:
Since it's already so cold out above the lake, anyway, don't come out unless it's summer.

Cirno:
You can't really put up much of a fight if your tummy hurts.

Marisa:
Wow. The cherry blossoms, bellflowers, and irises are all all blooming at the same time. Feels weird.

???:
It's because you're seeing them all at once...

Mystia:
That's why it's weird~

Marisa:
Well, I don't want my sight too short.

Mystia:
If you don't pay attention you might get hit ... 
By a bird's attack, that is!

Marisa:
I don't like birds circling overhead. Especially birds of prey.

Mystia:
The flowers are so pretty~ I'm going to catch some humans fascinated by the flowers today~‚ô™

Marisa:
It's so quiet here, above the clouds. Especially since it's so noisy back on the ground.

???:
What do you mean?

Lyrica:
It's only going to get louder from here on out.

Marisa:
Aah, it looks like that may be. But you're alone. So that's just a third of the usual clamor.

Lyrica:
Three times, actually, three times as much. You can hear my music much more clearly during my solo.

Marisa:
Alright, alright. A solo's noise definitely sounds clamorous.

Lyrica:
From here on out is the start of my solo tour.

Marisa:
I've just been flying around in circles for a while.

???:
Especially this time,

Tewi:
You won't get anywhere if you just fly about wandering all over the place!

Marisa:
Ah, a lucky item! How lucky.

Tewi:
I'm not an item... Oh, whatever.

Marisa:
Well, if you're not a lucky item, then you're a rare item. Good things will definitely come my way now!

Tewi:
You're not that great. Of course, you can't really beat a rabbit in a race.

Marisa:
I always get lost in this house.

???:
You're just making yourself at home again, aren't you?

Reisen:
As usual, you have no business being here.

Marisa:
That's not true. I came to ask about the flower outbreak today.

Reisen:
Why would we know anything about that?

Marisa:
Well, that was a waste of time. 
Everyone's probably noticed the flowers by now.

Reisen:
I'm going out to investigate the flowers. 
They don't seem to pose any threat, though.

Marisa:
Hmm. This place isn't all weird like I thought it'd be.

???:
The flowers are only behaving oddly in the world of the living.

Youmu:
Here, the cherry blossoms are but normal cherry blossoms.

Marisa:
Speaking of which, when we had that 
strange Winter, this place was in a normal Spring.

Youmu:
What are you trying to say? 
We have nothing to do with this excessive blooming.

Marisa:
Hmph. So you really don't have anything to do with it?

Youmu:
I was just preparing to investigate it myself.

Marisa:
Shouldn't the time for the Flower Viewing be soon?

???:
What do you mean, soon?

Reimu:
Flowers have been all over the place for quite some time, now!

Marisa:
That's why we can have a Flower Viewing.

Reimu:
You just want to party. You just want to drink!

Marisa:
During a Flower Viewing, viewing the danmaku might be nice, but the flowers are the prettiest, after all.

Reimu:
If you're the one that cleans up after the party, then I don't mind.

Marisa:
Wherever I go, flowers all around, hunh?

???:
Not exactly.

Sakuya:
The flowers do not grow within the forest, or upon the lake outside.

Marisa:
Outside? The forest wouldn't allow such weak plants.

Sakuya:
Can you evade everything that I have thrown?

Marisa:
Even if I avoid all your shots, the flowers will gladly take the hit.

Sakuya:
If you are so fascinated by these unnatural flowers, how can you hope to escape my attacks?

Marisa:
Hey, what's up?

???:
What?

Reimu:
I'm busy, you know!

Marisa:
Haven't you figured out what's going on, yet? You were wandering around just a little while ago, too.

Reimu:
I can't help it! The flowers are growing everywhere after all.

Marisa:
This is bad... I'm almost out of places to check.

Reimu:
That's why you shouldn't interfere with my work.

Marisa:
That's it, I should just start looking in the places I've never seen before...

Reimu:
I'll take care of this outbreak somehow, so you just sit back, enjoy the flowers, and sleep!

Marisa:
Man, I've got no leads, and I'm getting tired of chasing the culprit.

???:
If you tire,

Sakuya:
perhaps you should simply return home, and sleep?

Marisa:
I can't sleep in peace with all these flowers growing.

Sakuya:
However, you have not a single clue as to the cause or culprit, correct? There is little point to simply meandering about.

Marisa:
Then why are you doing the same thing?

Sakuya:
Because no clue as to the culprit or cause can be found.

Marisa:
I can't just wander around like this! I'll just have to look in the places I've never been to before.

Sakuya:
Really, just what is the cause?

Marisa:
This is really something. Everywhere I go the outbreak is covering everything, and I can't see the flow of the outbreak at all. Maybe it's because I can't sense any threat from this outbreak...

???:
It's not like you to be this deep in the mountains by a pond grumbling to yourself.

Marisa:
Who's there?!

Aya:
Rushing to the scene when something happens; That's what being a newspaper reporter is about.

Marisa:
A tengu, huh... Are you writing about the flower outbreak?

Aya:
Flowers, is it? Something like this just wouldn't make a good article, though...

Marisa:
Really? Flowers are growing all over Gensokyo, y'know?

Aya:
I don't sense a threat from the flowers. Besides, I think that maybe your actions would make a better story. The truth is, I came here to often write about you. I'm at the scene of the crime with a professional thief.

Marisa:
You've mistaken me for someone else.

Aya:
You were caught on film. The newspaper detailing your crime has already been published.

Marisa:
Secretly photographing people, hunh?... That's a bad hobby. I don't care if you're tengu or whatever, I'm busy with the flowers, now.

Aya:
It seems that way.

Marisa:
That's why I'll just beat you up to calm down! And you're gonna hand over the negatives.

Marisa:
How's that, you paparazzi?!

Aya:
Sheesh... What are you doing, attacking an upright citizen?

Marisa:
By the way, in spite of being a reporter you haven't looked into the flower outbreak at all?

Aya:
It's not that I haven't looked, but I don't think the large number of flowers is the true mystery.

Marisa:
What?

Aya:
Doesn't matter how you look at it, the numbers of ghosts have gone up more than the number of flowers. It's the ghosts...

Marisa:
You're talking with some sort of air of superiority, here.

Aya:
I thought it might make for a good story, so I didn't want to tell anyone, yet.

Aya:
You're an interesting human, but... If you're just going to attack me, I don't have anything to write about.

Marisa:
I see... ghosts. I was so focused upon the flowers, I didn't realize. Distracted by flowers and fairies, I couldn't see all the ghosts right under my nose. It's like the ghosts and the flowers are related, but unrelated at the same time.

???:
The only humans who come to Muenzuka are the ones that want to die.

Marisa:
Who wants to die, now?!

Komachi:
Now, now, there are so many wonderful things in this world. You are ten years too early to say that you want to die.

Marisa:
I won't want to die in ten years, either!

Komachi:
I'm the first class Sanzu river guide, Onozuka Komachi. I can't let you cross the river yet, if you try to force yourself through, now... I'll drop you in halfway across, so prepare yourself.

Marisa:
If I said I don't wanna die, then I don't wanna cross the Sanzu river. Wanting to fall into that river is just stupid. I just came here looking for the place with the highest concentration of ghosts. Gensokyo is overflowing with ghosts, now.

Komachi:
Ghosts? Aah, ghosts, ghosts? The ghosts are increasing?

Marisa:
As you can see, the situation is where flowers, fairies, and if you look a little harder, ghosts are everywhere.

Komachi:
Aah, what a problem. Now I'm swamped in work, and I can't possibly catch up. All these ghosts are waiting to cross Sanzu no Kawa...

Marisa:
Isn't it YOUR job to ferry them across the Sanzu no Kawa?It would've been fine if you'd just done your job; It's pretty negligent to just let them accumulate.

Komachi:
But it's MY job~ Let me do my job at my own pace!

Marisa:
You're getting angry at the wrong person. Why'd so many ghosts show up here in the first place? Aren't they from the outside world?

Komachi:
Who knows? I just know that they're human souls that don't accept that they've died, and still think they don't want to. It's not really good for them to force them across, so just wait a bit.

Marisa:
Just ferry them to Higan already! If you don't normalize the number ghosts, it's bad for the boundary.

Komachi:
Don't get so worked up, I'm doing my best.

Marisa:
You look like you know you're lazy. Just like a certain shrine maiden.

Komachi:
Is that so? I will show no mercy to those that interrupt my laid-back pace of working. Return! For living humans, the width of the Sanzu river is infinite! I won't let you cross!

Marisa:
Oh, just ferry those ghosts to Higan.

Komachi:
But with this insane number it's impossible~

Marisa:
Well, I can't do it. So obviously, it's got to be you.

???:
Are you slacking off?! Komachi!

Komachi:
Kyan!

Marisa:
See? Now you're in trouble with your boss.

Komachi:
Why is such an energetic human trying to die?... It's the end of the world, huh.

???:
After Komachi didn't bring back any souls for such a long period of time, I came to check up on the situation... Higan is full of ghosts. Furthermore, the flowers have started growing out of... Komachi! This isn't the time to play around with humans.

Marisa:
She was drunk and slacking. If you're the boss you've gotta lay down the law.

Eiki:
Komachi, I thought you were a more diligent person...

Marisa:
Well, that's fine. So the ghosts were caused by her slacking... But what are the flowers, really?

Eiki:
Well, the flowers... The flowers are the emotions of deceased humans and ghosts, manifested. When ghosts lose their way, they rely upon the flowers Unable to travel to Higan, and without any connections whatsoever, and without realizing their own state of death, the humans possess flowers.

Marisa:
Eeeeew. You're saying the flowers are all dead people? I picked some earlier. Actually, en masse.

Eiki:
Mass murders, then.

Marisa:
Well, it's fine, since they can achieve nirvana that way.

Eiki:
Let's talk about you, instead.

Eiki:
Yes, you are a little too comfortable with lying.

Marisa:
That isn't true. I haven't told a single lie since I was born.

Eiki:
If you insist on this path, at this rate... Your tongue will be ripped out.

Marisa:
Huh? That's the sort of junk old people say.

Eiki:
You should take the time to re-examine your lifestyle. Were I in charge of the judgement of your soul, you would be punished by the removal of your tongue.

Marisa:
That so? Maybe I should pack a spare tongue in case of my death, then?

Eiki:
Your second tongue would also be ripped out. It'd probably be best to also fix that sassy mouth of yours.

Marisa:
Well, if that's the case, the only way to keep my tongue is to defeat you, isn't it?

Eiki:
Hell exists not to punish sinners, but to ensure that nobody sins in the first place. I am here so that everybody realizes that. Even if I must hurt you a little, I must make you correct the error of your ways!

Eiki:
Until you understand why I must stop you from telling lies, I will continue to punish you.

Reimu:
Who're you?

Reimu:
Forests don't have any plants as fancy as a flower, does it? And that's why you're weak.

Reimu:
A flower petal's falling more naturally, you know. Unnatural straightness like that isn't going to work out.

Reimu:
Can you see the fairy with the flower? That's the proof that the flower's not natural. Since fairies are nature itself, they're having an uproar with the flowers that are unnatural.

Reimu:
Metal on flowers' just a sad thing. Do pick it up before you go back, will you?

Reimu:
At times like this, I feel sorry for whoever can't walk outside during daytime.

Reimu:
Your name... points to which flower's blooming?

Reimu:
Must be nice; otherworldly people can be carefree all the time.

Reimu:
Why don't we have a flower viewing in the other world, instead of always at the shrine?

Reimu:
By the way, I heard your rabbit's doing mischief here and there.

Reimu:
Oh, right. I saw the moon waning in a breakneck speed before. Was that you and your friends' doing?

Reimu:
You're the one fairy we don't need in spring.

Reimu:
Don't you go wild. Flowers are gonna wilt.

Reimu:
Too noisy. Spirits are supposed to come out more subtly.

Reimu:
Really, your sound's dangerous-it makes me all hyper.

Reimu:
Being with you makes me somewhat gloomy.

Reimu:
First time I've seen you in a bright place and you look weird.

Reimu:
Amazing, how you can sing without even drinking.

Reimu:
Rabbits seem to be increasing nowadays. Must be rabbit hunting season again, I guess?

Reimu:
Now go write a heroic tale about me beating a tengu or something!

Reimu:
Why do you always make a news just out of people's failure?

Reimu:
Too much poison's going to be bad for you.

Reimu:
Great, more bothersome ones.

Reimu:
By the way, this mishap's your doing, right? I knew it from the start.

Reimu:
Why do you have so much money?

Reimu:
Before you talk about anyone else, how about you? You really didn't do anything wrong?

Reimu:
Can I really kill time in a place like this? This is all flowers' fault.

Reimu:
Spring breeze making flowers fall is just about the right level.

Reimu:
Doesn't really matter to me, but... Flowers are just gonna fall after blooming, right? After that, this year's gonna be over so soon?

Marisa:
Today it's your turn to take care of cooking and all that.

Marisa:
You worry too much. I don't think all the flowers blooming at once is a bad sign.

Marisa:
Did you know? The cherry blossoms in Kourindou turned unnaturally white. I think that's a sign of a disaster.

Marisa:
I'm heading back. Playing alone is no fun.

Marisa:
You're alone today? I guess Remilia doesn't need a babysitter.

Marisa:
How about taking this pheasant's eye and putting it the tea for your mistress to drink?

Marisa:
Oh yeah. I haven't been to that world lately. Although this world is overwhelmingly more gorgeous.

Marisa:
If the flowering incident can reach the Netherworld, then maybe that cherry tree might bloom, too.

Marisa:
My eyes are tired lately. Mix me some eye treatment medicine, will you?

Marisa:
Oh? Your eyes are red, too.

Marisa:
I don't get why you like the cold at all. I don't get your existence in general, really.

Marisa:
What will you do to take down those other fairies?

Marisa:
For some reason you're noisier alone than when you're together.

Marisa:
Oh? This is some nice sound. You're the best of the three.

Marisa:
Violins sound like scratching on a wooden plank.

Marisa:
You're just a simple bird in daylight. But not a sparrow.

Marisa:
My firepower doesn't settle down to roasting chicken, does it?

Marisa:
Give me more luck, will you? The kind that makes rare things come out when I ask for my fortunes.

Marisa:
Speaking of which, the shrine around these parts gave me a spell card when I asked for my fortune. Now that was rare.

Marisa:
Oh yeah, go bring me newspaper that has my stories on it this time!

Marisa:
Whatever anyone says, even something you eat every day could be full of poison.

Marisa:
I picked up something that looked like preserved foods from the outside world recently! It's called "space food", I think, that's what Kourin said. It's in this weird capsule.... It's supposed to be a taste of space, but is it poisonous?

Marisa:
You're not behind all this? Nobody would think it's strange for it to be you.

Marisa:
What time period did this money come from? Can I really use this?

Marisa:
I don't intend to tell lies.

Marisa:
Lies are convenient. That said, I don't have any intentions to lie.

Marisa:
There's too many flowers. My color perception is going berserk.

Marisa:
The fragrance is strong, too. My nose is going to malfunction.

Sakuya:
Even Reimu doesn't know where the cherry blossoms are going, this is dangerous.

Sakuya:
The scope of the incident is so broad that I can't figure out the perpetrator's intention. Who would benefit from this incident?

Sakuya:
Have you noticed? The shrine's cherry blossoms have bloomed thrice already. They scatter and bloom, then scatter and bloom again....

Sakuya:
When you move, cherry blossoms scatter. Could you not walk a little more gracefully?

Sakuya:
Look, there are petals on your hat.

Sakuya:
I was concerned, but... There aren't many changes in the forest. Perhaps I should pursue the perpetrator along this route?

Sakuya:
You should practice stopping time at this level.

Sakuya:
Do you get orders from your mistress?

Sakuya:
It's nice that ghosts are so carefree. They don't seem to be thinking about anything.

Sakuya:
The mochi that the moon rabbit made was just normal mochi, wasn't it.

Sakuya:
Yeah, ever since then we've been trying hard to reach the moon but.... isn't there a good way to do that?

Sakuya:
It's wrong to think you are stronger than frogs. Because fairies are of the lowest rank.

Sakuya:
I hate playing above the lake. It's such a hassle to retrieve my knives.

Sakuya:
My, you're alone today? Are you lost?

Sakuya:
I'm not really familiar with trumpets. But, are they silver?

Sakuya:
We have a violin at home, too. Though it's only for decoration.

Sakuya:
If I had to say which was better, a bird's song or your song, well...

Sakuya:
You sing unusual songs.

Sakuya:
The carrot I found the other day was a rare one. When I uprooted it, it let out a sad cry.

Sakuya:
I wonder if you can eat ginseng carrots as well?

Sakuya:
So there was a newspaper running here after all! But there isn't much to report about in such a peaceful place.

Sakuya:
If you're killing time alone, why don't you come sell medicine at my place? We don't have a pharmacy that specializes in poison around here anyways.

Sakuya:
Do you think I could get sunflower seeds from you? In bulk. Their oil is very useful.

Sakuya:
Even if one's money is taken by a shinigami, in a way they're just giving it to you freely.

Sakuya:
Suicide prevention by such attacks.... What's the point of that?

Sakuya:
A statute of limitations for a crime is a ridiculous thing to talk of, but I wonder if there is such a statute in your trials?

Sakuya:
It's not good if the smell of flowers is too strong.

Sakuya:
I heard a rumor in the wind about humans weak to pollen. Maybe it's untrue.

Youmu:
Since you're so carefree, I wonder if the disaster is worsening?

Youmu:
Please don't just make merry, won't you investigate the disaster a little?

Youmu:
That's right, your master has said nothing of this disaster.

Youmu:
I have come across death on the path of a phantom.

Youmu:
Have the people of your house said nothing of this disaster?

Youmu:
Your chill and the freezing temperature of phantoms. Shall I test which one is colder?

Youmu:
Ah, will we be having you at the banquet? If you don't come, the mistress will be angry.

Youmu:
I'm looking forward to the banquet. You'll be coming, right?

Youmu:
Where are you going for a concert this time? The sunflower fields?

Youmu:
The side dish for tonight is.... Hey, why did I suddenly think of dinner?

Youmu:
Why is your hair black?

Youmu:
Everyone is much too busy to have free time to read the newspaper, surely.

Youmu:
Phantoms are not really susceptible to poisons... or so we thought, but we're actually quite weak to them. I wonder, where do we absorb it from?

Youmu:
When I look at you, it reminds me of someone. That carefree spirit and those red and white clothes.

Youmu:
Much appreciated. How are the souls, recently? Are there any humans who can go to heaven right from the start?

Youmu:
Ah, I'm sorry for all the troubles I've caused. Thanks to you, I've come to understand the Hakurouken's reason for being.

Youmu:
Oh, that's right. My mistress is a ghost.... Why can't she enter nirvana...?

Youmu:
Playing around here is a waste of time.

Youmu:
Feels like Miss Yuyuko might know something....

Reisen:
There are times where your wavelengths are alternately unusually long or unusually short.

Reisen:
Sometimes there are people with wavelengths like that. A voice like that matches with no one's and reacts against no one's. It's mysterious.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths seem are relatively normal. When I see you like this they're stabilized.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are a little long. Actually, they seem to be getting relaxed.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are comparitively longish. Well, that's what I'm seeing.

Reisen:
Huh? Maybe my eyes are a little red today...

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are short. I wonder if that's because you have a tempestuous disposition.

Reisen:
Do your wavelengths change along with the music? Or does the sound come out according to your wavelengths?

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are pretty long. Those fluctuations are ones that feel good.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are pretty short. Those fluctuations are ones that make people uneasy.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are pretty short. Is it hard for you to convey what you're thinking?

Reisen:
Hey, where were you wandering off to?

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are outstandingly short even for a rabbit, I can tell as soon as I get close to you.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are stabilized. It seems like they could synchronize with anyone's wavelengths.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are incomparably short. Does this mean your voice doesn't reach normal people?

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are incomparably long. The wavelengths of flowers are like that, too.

Reisen:
Your wavelengths are fairly short. Although since you always miss work I thought they were long.

Reisen:
Topology bends before your wavelengths... They're waves that don't disturb epigeal lifeforms at all. So you can judge people.

Reisen:
The reason some get along and some don't is because all individual living things have their own wavelengths.

Reisen:
You can generally understand the personalities of those whose wavelengths you see. Those with short ones are rough, and those with long ones are carefree.

Cirno:
The miko can't do anything this time!

Cirno:
Won't you go over to those other fairies for me?

Cirno:
No matter how much humans try, they can't use the power of fairies!

Cirno:
Even with all that layering, it's useless! You can't keep out of the cold.

Cirno:
Icicles are a better weapon than knives!

Cirno:
If you wanna see how arrogant humans are, there you go.

Cirno:
You can't scare me with that blade! Why? Because I am the strongest.

Cirno:
I know all about it! That rabbits turn white in the winter.

Cirno:
When it comes to me, I'm the strongest.

Cirno:
Quiet, you've been clanging and banging since the morning!

Cirno:
Sheesh! What's that echoing sound in my head!?!

Cirno:
If you play out a sound like that, it could crack ice!

Cirno:
My ice even makes the flying birds drop down.

Cirno:
I won't lose to a rabbit that can't cross the sea!

Cirno:
Did you see? A big incident came up and scared the heck out of everyone!

Cirno:
Fairies are not so weak that they can be looked down upon by dolls!

Cirno:
I'll make you into an ice flower!

Cirno:
It's no use to lure me with money! I don't want it anyway.

Cirno:
What's that? Thinking about such difficult things is boring, you know.

Cirno:
Make fun of me and your tongue will get scalded!

Cirno:
There is nothing I can't freeze!

Lyrica:
There's not a lot of dead sounds in the shrine, huh.

Lyrica:
Did you know if you strain your ears in magical forests that you can hear the sound of mushrooms growing?

Lyrica:
Rainbows are the bass sounds of this world. Exceeding the rainbows are illusionary sounds. That's where I come in.

Lyrica:
I wonder what kind of sound the sound of a ghost is?

Lyrica:
When you're able to tamper with the waves, you're like a synthesizer.

Lyrica:
You freeze sound as well as things. The sound of the ice breaking is the sound of those sounds melting.

Lyrica:
Huh, that keyboard is better...

Lyrica:
See, aren't I the greatest?

Lyrica:
See, aren't I the greatest?

Lyrica:
You're blessed by song, aren't you?

Lyrica:
Have you heard the "pyon" sound when a rabbit jumps? Or maybe it was an illusion?

Lyrica:
Because newspapers don't make sound... If you made it so they could maybe everyone would buy it?

Lyrica:
That's right. I've seen a doll that makes sound. But it was a chimpanzee.

Lyrica:
I had a dream about flowers that danced in response to sound.

Lyrica:
That reminds me, the sound of jingling coins in the outside world is decreasing as well.

Lyrica:
Ah, the sound of a sermon is becoming an illusionary sound. The amount of people preaching is decreasing, right?

Lyrica:
The soul of this keyboard is already packed with sounds that have passed away.

Lyrica:
I wonder if there is anyone who can make the sound of speechlessness...

Merlin:
Listen up if you can hear my performance, even if you're a shrine maiden! It's cheerful like this!

Merlin:
What comes out of a trumpet isn't a laser but a happy sound.

Merlin:
Hey, it'd be great if the devious maid could steadily get happier~.

Merlin:
Listen to my solo performance, even if you're that serious half-ghost. Here, it goes like this!

Merlin:
Hey, let's start pounding mochi with this high tension!

Merlin:
Listen, even if you're a fairy who's always merry! You're always happy, so you won't change.

Merlin:
How is this? Lyrica's illusory sound. Did you not expect it to go with my noisy sound?

Merlin:
It was bad for the two of us, but of course my sound is best.

Merlin:
Hey, a depressing song like that is no good! Now I'm best.

Merlin:
Come! Sing nonstop!

Merlin:
Come now, let's dance the rabbit dance!

Merlin:
Let's scatter newspapers from the sky! Delivering the paper is a piece of cake.

Merlin:
There are poisons to make you happy, too! Come now, use them steadily.

Merlin:
Sunflowers have to bloom in happiness! With the sunflower effect they'll get brighter and brighter.

Merlin:
Let's cross the river nonstop! We'll even sing a merry boatman's song!

Merlin:
Isn't this great. You even provided a little amnesty! This year the flowers are blooming like this.

Merlin:
Hey, if you listen to my performance you'll be happy!

Merlin:
No matter what the situation, never forget your happy soul!

Lunasa:
You're a little overexcited for a shrine maiden. Watch over the incident with composure.

Lunasa:
It's scary to take actions against bombs dropped like yours.

Lunasa:
Hey, now I remember what's going on with you. You're locked up by a demon.

Lunasa:
In a level-headed way.... Think about your current circumstances.

Lunasa:
When I see your sad state, there's no limit to which the flowers could grow.

Lunasa:
Calm down. You're making yourself look foolish.

Lunasa:
The sound is dying. I'll look for a more unearthly sound.

Lunasa:
You missed a note. Practice with your feet firmly on the ground.

Lunasa:
Huh, the sound's a bit off...

Lunasa:
Pick a song and let's sing. Or do you only have weird songs?

Lunasa:
Please walk more calmly.

Lunasa:
I wonder how many volumes one's autobiography would be if they looked back a bit.

Lunasa:
You were born in a sad environment. It's no time to be merry.

Lunasa:
Sunflowers turn to the sun out of jealousy and want. Of course I wouldn't call them cheerful flowers.

Lunasa:
I think if the mood around you weren't always that of a funeral, it wouldn't feel like you've died.

Lunasa:
I wonder if the trials in hell are noisy. Do you judge because you're fascinated by the opposition of the ghosts?

Lunasa:
That's right. You're a little too excited, so calm down.

Lunasa:
If you don't calm down a little more, even what's been determined won't settle.

Tewi:
That's right, if Reimu makes the torii face south instead of east, more good luck will come to her~

Tewi:
Don't you want to know how to earn more donations? You don't. Okay.

Tewi:
If Marisa built her home outside the forest, she would receive good luck~

Tewi:
If Sakuya left the mansion behind and lived alone, she would receive good luck~

Tewi:
If Youmu stabbed herself with that sword, she would receive greater good luck~

Tewi:
Ah! I've still got a few more things to do, so just wait!

Tewi:
Do you want to catch frogs of higher rank? I might have some good ideas.... 
[Perhaps unrelated, but Cirno would later get swallowed by a giant toad.]

Tewi:
Ah, you're living a pretty blessed lifestyle, aren't you. I'm feeling your happiness warmly over here.

Tewi:
You're also planning a solo live concert? Then leave the promotions to me.

Tewi:
That's quite an old violin. Do you know Stradivari?

Tewi:
You see, I've thought this through. It would be best if you started a new business, I think. 
[Mystia would later open a grilled lamprey stand.]

Tewi:
There sure are a lot of cute rabbits around here.

Tewi:
Do you want to increase your paper's subscriptions? I've got a good idea but....

Tewi:
Poison is a kind of treasure, so if you don't take care of it well.... How about it? Why don't you let me keep them safe for you?

Tewi:
Why don't you make this incident as if it's your own? I think you should be able to do that.

Tewi:
What are you going to do with your money, having so much that you can throw them away like this?

Tewi:
See, I'm making everyone attain happiness. Do I redeem myself from hell now?

Tewi:
Everyone, if you listen to what I have to say you'll be more happy~

Tewi:
If you want to be happier, it means holding deeper emotions.

Aya:
Of course, when I'm stuck for stories I'm limited to those of shrine maidens. After this as well I'll be looking forward to fun activities from you.

Aya:
By the way, no matter how much you steal, I don't find fault in it. Because that would work against the newspaper. You always have to watch with an objective eye.

Aya:
I'm always indebted to the Scarlet Devil Mansion. There is no other place with quite as many strange incidents.

Aya:
I don't often visit that world, but... I have to wonder if maybe there are interesting stories there.

Aya:
That reminds me, the mochi the Moon Rabbit was pounding was just an everyday mochi, wasn't it.

Aya:
I'd like to do a write-up on fairies if something big happens. Will I have the chance?

Aya:
Because nothing really happens, it's impossible to write only of the Prismriver Sisters' concerts.

Aya:
Ah, the trumpet sounds lovely. I'd like to put together a feature in the paper like that.

Aya:
Where will you be holding your next performance? A sunflower field?

Aya:
That's right. I also think grilled chicken is bad.

Aya:
Even if I got my hands on proof that you were swindling me, writing it up in the paper would be...

Aya:
"Learn wisdom by faults of others." Those who write for the paper must demonstrate good conduct no matter what.

Aya:
Could you be.... a doll? Surely not.

Aya:
Avoid the appearance of evil, and avoid compromising situations. It's better for you to be docile.

Aya:
The story of a dead person is a treasure chest for scandal. But there's the problem that it might be an old story to everyone.

Aya:
Ah, that's right. May I collect data on you until the equinoctial week? I'd like to do a documentary write-up called "Getting to the Heart of how the Presiding Judge of Gensokyo Spends her Daily Life."

Aya:
Extra, extra! An extra of the Bunbunmaru newspaper to deliver the truth, the best in Gensokyo!

Aya:
How about it? Won't you take a copy of the Bunbunmaru Newspaper?

Medicine:
Sake is poison for the body if you drink too much.

Medicine:
Strange-looking mushrooms are usually poisonous. So you'd better not eat them, thinking that it's interesting.

Medicine:
I wonder how it is to make tea from strange plants as they are rare.

Medicine:
The poison that is effective on ghosts is that which is effective on the soul.

Medicine:
The moon's light is a poisonous light ray. That's a thing worth learning.

Medicine:
If one's true intentions are too cold they are poison to the body.

Medicine:
There are song that act as poison as well. Songs that bring about an abnormality in the mind.

Medicine:
When we talk of poisons there are many. Of course, there are those that enhance the mind as well.

Medicine:
A song that drives one to suicide is a wonderful poison.

Medicine:
Wings are able to stir up the wind and spread poison. On top of that, once poison is stuck, it is hard to get off.

Medicine:
If poison inflames the skin it is best to soak it in ocean water. It might sting a little but stick it out, stick it out.

Medicine:
Ahhh, I said don't fan the defeated like that!

Medicine:
My, is the poison making me hallucinate?

Medicine:
To think if sunflowers had poison. No flower would be as unpleasant as such.

Medicine:
Is it true that the people who died of poison have beautiful spirits?

Medicine:
Which is a heavier crime, committing suicide by drinking poison, or committing murder by making others drink poison?

Medicine:
It's often been said that small dosages of poison can be medicine.

Medicine:
What's wrong? Have you ingested poison?

Yuuka:
Oh, long time no see. Still being a poor miko, I see.

Yuuka:
Ah, you're still alive? You've grown up quite a bit.

Yuuka:
What do you think of evening primroses? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you.

Yuuka:
What do you think of skunk cabbages? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you. [lit. "Water bananas"]

Yuuka:
What do you think of lantern plants? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you.

Yuuka:
What do you think of creeping saxifrages? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you. [lit. "Under the snow"]

Yuuka:
What do you think of dancing artificial flowers? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you. [lit. "Flower rock"]

Yuuka:
What do you think of dancing artificial flowers? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you.

Yuuka:
What do you think of dancing artificial flowers? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you.

Yuuka:
What do you think of dragonfly fireworks? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you. [The Japanese word for fireworks is "flower-fire".]

Yuuka:
What do you think of flower-viewing sake? Oh, I'm just thinking of flowers that suit you.

Yuuka:
What do you think of pine flowers? Oh, that rural feeling fits you perfectly.

Yuuka:
Gelsemium elegans. That is the plant with the deadliest poison. That thing might be able to kill you, even.

Yuuka:
The sunflowers are getting tired, I see.

Yuuka:
Fires and fights? No, just thinking of flowers that suit you. [It's been said that fires and fights are the flowers of Edo, and Komachi is modelled after its people.]

Yuuka:
What kind of flower blooms in hell? Flowers that have committed sins, surely.

Yuuka:
Flowers bloom only with the colors held in soil, and as petals they return to the soil. It is the same with the flowers of living things. They take in the colors of their surroundings and bloom into beautiful flowers. Then, once they've bloomed, they return the colors to their surroundings.

Yuuka:
There are very few people who can make their own flowers bloom. If you want to know why, it's because most don't let go of the selfish intention of only making their flower finish blooming. What causes flowers to bloom is the power of the soil. So, don't forget to give back to the soil when you bloom.

Komachi:
There are two kinds of shrine maiden in this world; ones who live extremely long and ones who live extremely short.

Komachi:
When you die, what kind of ghost will you be? I can't imagine.

Komachi:
When I watch you closely, you have a face that makes you seem like you'll never die.

Komachi:
Of course, the words I would use for someone like you would be "sitting side by side with death."

Komachi:
Do you know why it is said rabbits will die if they are lonely? It's a pun that comes from the fact that "usagi" and "fusagi" sound the same. Depression brings about death.

Komachi:
Fairies and phantoms exist in a similar fashion. That's why you have no life span.

Komachi:
It's no fun looking at someone with no life span. ..Then again, am I working as a shinigami 'cause it's fun?

Komachi:
It's no fun looking at someone with no life span. ..Then again, am I working as a shinigami 'cause it's fun?

Komachi:
It's no fun looking at someone with no life span. ..Then again, am I working as a shinigami 'cause it's fun?

Komachi:
Does a small bird feel the fear of death?

Komachi:
Do you know why it is said rabbits will die if they are lonely? It's a pun that comes from the fact that "usagi" and "fusagi" sound the same. Depression brings about death.

Komachi:
You've been living for a long time. Is your personality that doesn't show that at all just an act?

Komachi:
Another one without a lifespan. That means another one who has not yet been born, does it?

Komachi:
Maybe it's because the lifespan of youkai is ever-so-changing. You might die tomorrow, or you might die after a hundred thousand years.

Komachi:
Being a shinigami doesn't mean killing people just here and there.

Komachi:
Oh, sorry! I'll work seriously from now on!

Komachi:
Why don't I tell you something to keep you from ever contemplating suicide? Do not think of yourself going to hell after death. If you think that a paradise beyond that of your wildest imaginations, on the contrary the will to live will spill forth.

Komachi:
Take great care for the bonds between a person and another. To a shinigami's eye, an isolated human is determined to be the least virtuous spirit.

Komachi:
Hey, I can see your lifespan. The shinigami's eye. I can give it to you for half your lifespan if you want?

Eiki:
Exterminating Youkai. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Returning those sundries you gathered back to the earth. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Having strong link with humans. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Listening to your mistress's words every day. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Gathering round things and offering them. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Going to different places and knowing the world. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Respecting your elders. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Performing more in the graveyard. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Controlling your sisters' sounds well. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Understanding the power of your own song. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Taking care of your family. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Actively picking up good news. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Losing the hatred toward humans. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Terrorizing humans more. This is the good deed you can do right now.

Eiki:
Hey, wait a minute! You don't have time to play around here!

Eiki:
Huh, so bored... With all these ghosts around, too...

Eiki:
So, did you do some good deeds?

Eiki:
If only it was as honest as you people, trial would be so much easier. So many people are mistakenly believing that trial can be easily done by knowledge of law and money. When did humans became able to judge other humans, anyway? So much conceit.

Reimu:
I can't really see through all the falling leaves... Can I really make it all the way to the mountain like this?
Huh? I smell something tasty...

???:
Even though you're a shrine maiden, you want to eat a god?
How ridiculous! What insolence!

Reimu:
Who said I was going to eat you? But is that delicious smell coming from you?

Minoriko:
Gods always put a great deal of care into their odor. Oh, by the way, I'm the harvest god.

Reimu:
Mmmm, so that's why you smell like half-baked sweet potatoes.

Minoriko:
Freshly-harvested sweet potatoes make up my perfume. Do you think I'm going to let a shrine maiden eat me!?

Reimu:
That was pretty weak, for a god. I wonder if my shrine's god is any stronger?
Well, this is no time for baking sweet potatoes.
Better hurry on ahead.

Reimu:
I've been feeling awful all this while...
The atmosphere is so heavy... It's just noon, but the sun doesn't shine here.

???:
Oh, are you still there?

???:
And I was trying to chase you away just now...

Reimu:
When?

???:
Oh, never mind, it doesn't matter. My job is chasing away lost humans.

Reimu:
But I'm not lost. I just want to go to the mountain.

Hina:
What are you going to do there? Don't you know it's dangerous?

Reimu:
If you get in my way, I'll treat you like an enemy.

Hina:
I'm a friend of humans. I take their misfortune and pass them on to the gods.
If you like, I can take on all of your tragedies.

Reimu:
Youkai are my enemies. You're a youkai.

Hina:
Oh, really!

Hina:
I was just trying to be nice and chase you away...

Reimu:
Chasing me away really isn't that nice.

Hina:
From here on is the world where the gods live.
You'll regret this. It's no place for humans to go.

Reimu:
Oh, good. It looks like I finally made it to Youkai Mountain.

???:
Ack, a human!?

Reimu:
H-huh? Where are you going?

???:
Awww, my optical camouflage suit broke!

Reimu:
What's that?

???:
You're a human, but you picked me out pretty well from the camo.

Reimu:
That's because my eyes are really good. Or, maybe you weren't really hiding.

???:
See you, human! By the way, it's dangerous if you go any further„Éº

Reimu:
I'll still be going, anyway.

???:
Hey, it's that human from before. Didn't I tell you not to go any deeper?

Reimu:
You really got in my way back there.

???:
Did I? I don't even know what you're doing.
How can I get in your way?

Reimu:
I have urgent business with the god that lives on top of the mountain. Will you let me through?

???:
The god on top of the mountain? But many gods live up there ...
Let me tell you straight up ... You'd better leave.

Nitori:
I'm Nitori Kawashiro. They call me Nitori the Valley Kappa.
Go on now, better get back to the village. There's lots of folks who don't like humans up ahead.

Reimu:
Oh, I know that. But sometimes there are things you just have to do.

Nitori:
Oh my, it's been so long since I met a human, my sworn friends. Why did it have to turn out this way...
Oh well, if you really want to get into the mountain, you'll have to show me how serious you are!

Nitori:
You're, you're strong, I can't believe my weapons couldn't beat you ... I didn't think humans were that strong.

Reimu:
Well, time to move on.

Nitori:
Hey human. Kappa and humans have been sworn friends since ancient times, so let me tell you something.

Reimu:
Sworn friends?
Are you sure you haven't mistaken an old enemy for a friend?

Nitori:
It's true that there's been a restless god on top of the mountain lately.
Are you going to go beat her?

Reimu:
Well, what an unexpected place to get such great information. I'd forgotten why I'd come all the way up here.

Nitori:
I can't believe it. Humans are so flaky. I knew I should have asked the tengu about this instead.
Well, I'll tell the kappa around here about you, So just go on ahead.

Reimu:
I can see a waterfall up ahead ... And now for the main event!

???:
Ayayayaya...

Aya:
I came to check on that intruder report, but I never thought it'd be you...

Reimu:
I don't have any business with any of you tengu. Get out of the way.

Aya:
We received an intruder alert, and for some reason they called me onto the job.
I'm just a simple newspaper reporter...

Reimu:
What are you trying to say?

Aya:
It's because I'm the one that knows the most about you.
Maybe it would be best if I could talk you out of it. That was the boss' plan.

Reimu:
I told you before, I don't have any business with the tengu. I just want to see the god that lives on the mountain.

Aya:
The god of the mountain?
Aha~ So, you mean that god?

Reimu:
Do you know something about her?

Aya:
Lately, there's a god that's been giving even us some trouble.
She keeps acting like this mountain is hers...
And she's even come down to the foot of the mountain lately to try and gather faith...

Reimu:
...So she's gathering faith.
That's got to be her. I want to meet with her. Where is she?

Aya:
If she really got out of hand, we tengu were going to go beat her, so you don't need to do anything.

Reimu:
Oh, come on, I've come all this way. Take me to wherever this god is!

Aya:
But there's no way I can let you through.

Aya:
The tengu patrollers won't stand for it if I let you through that easily.

Reimu:
Geez. You tengu are such a pain.

Aya:
Belonging to a group means that sometimes, you don't get to have your way.
Now, I'll go easy on you, So come at me with all your might!

Reimu:
Thanks for going easy on me, but... You could just let me through, you know.

Aya:
I don't have to fight seriously that much, but you were stronger than I expected.
At this rate, maybe you could even beat that pain of a god.

Reimu:
Now, take me to where she is already!

Aya:
That god showed up here not too long ago with a shrine and a lake.
There's a new shrine up the way a bit. She should be there.

Reimu:
A shrine on top of the mountain? 
I thought mine was the only one...

???:
If a shrine maiden like you is coming up the mountain...
Maybe you want to join up with us right away?

Reimu:
Well, this sure looks like a shrine... I guess there was another shrine besides mine.

???:
This is the Moriya Shrine, a long-forgotten shrine of the past.
It was moved into Gensokyo from the outside world together with the lake.

Reimu:
You moved a shrine and a lake? That's pretty flashy.

???:
My god and I will be taking over this mountain now. Then, if we can take over your shrine‚Äî
All of Gensokyo's faith will be ours...

Reimu:
If you do that, Gensokyo's eight million gods won't be so quiet for sure.

???:
This is also for Gensokyo's good.
Gensokyo will become weak if it continues in its current state of lessened piety.
We'll lose the power to cause miracles.

Reimu:
You've gotta be kidding. I'll be able to restore Gensokyo's piety somehow with my powers!

Sanae:
I'm Sanae, a wind priestess, descendent of a long-forgotten line of gods incarnate in the outside world.
Sometimes, humans that revere a god are themselves revered. Sometimes, shrine maidens can become gods.
Since you're a shrine maiden, are you prepared for such things to happen?

Reimu:
I don't care if I become a god or not.
But if you say you want a fight, you'd better be ready for one!

Sanae:
I see. Then, maybe you should watch and consider the power of a living god...
The divine power to cause miracles!

Sanae:
You're strong...
If you're this powerful, why doesn't your shrine have more followers?

Reimu:
I'd like to know that myself.

Sanae:
I think you'd probably get a great deal of faith If we even just made you a branch shrine for my god...

Reimu:
Hmmm, I'll think it over, but first I'd have to meet that god.

Sanae:
What!? You mean, your goal is...

Reimu:
To go punish a god that's doing bad things.

Reimu:
I've made it to the lake. She should be somewhere around here.
What is it with all these ominous pillars on this mountain? Well, come on out!

???:
Who calls for My presence?
Oh? Why, it must be the shrine maiden from the down the mountain.
What is your business here?

Reimu:
Quite a frank god, aren't you?

???:
These days it's easier to win faith with a friendly attitude than with a solemn air and august presence.

Reimu:
Whatever, it'd be a problem you tried to take over my shrine. Please don't do that, ok?

???:
I don't wish to take over your shrine!
I wish to save it.
I wish to bring more people to it. I wish to deliver it from the wicked clutches of youkai.

Reimu:
It's really none of your business.
Besides, even if we did set you up in my shrine, I'm not sure that would net any faith.

Kanako:
It's not as if your faith can go below zero.
What Gensokyo lacks... is hearts that believe in gods.
A shrine maiden like you should understand that, yes?

Reimu:
I think it would be nice if more people would come to visit the shrine too.
But I can do something about it on my own... I don't need to borrow your powers...

Kanako:
A shrine does not exist for its maiden.
A shrine is a home for a god. Now, I think...
It is time for you to seriously rethink the purpose of a shrine!

Marisa:
Aw, man... It's been a while, so I'm out of shape. I could use some practice.
Sure would be nice if someone strong would show up...

???:
You say that as if it were nothing at all.

???:
But you're a human, and humans are supposed to be afraid of youkai!

Marisa:
I'm afraid of other things, too.

Minoriko:
Where you're trying to go, the youkai are very different from those you've seen before.

Marisa:
That sounds like fun. So, you're stronger than a youkai, right?

Minoriko:
I'm just one amongst the multitudes of gods. There are many more here just like me.

Marisa:
Just more of the same after all, huh?
Guess I can't expect much.

Marisa:
If I have to keep fighting like this, I'll never make it to the mountain.
I could recite all the digits of pi before I got there.

???:
Oh, are you still here?

Marisa:
"How I like a drink, alcoholic of course,
after the light skirmish involving danmaku exchanges."

???:
Is that some sort of spell?

Marisa:
Ah, a new face. Who're you?

???:
I'm sure we've met before, but I'm just here to gather misfortune, now.

Marisa:
Hm, better keep my fingers crossed then.

Hina:
It's because I cross my fingers for you that humans can live in peace.
The mountain is no place for mortals.

Marisa:
Oh, but it's just starting to get good. Stay out of my way.

Hina:
Every disaster will befall you. I can't let you pass, even to protect humans!

Hina:
Oof...

Marisa:
"...after the light skirmish involving danmaku exchanges..." What comes after this, again?

Hina:
I don't understand what you're saying. Wanting to go to the mountain... are you really human?

Marisa:
How I'd like a drink... Well, anyway, only humans would memorise pi.
Therefore, I'm human.

???:
Ack, a human!?

Marisa:
Huh? She ran away.

???:
Awww, my optical camouflage suit broke!

Marisa:
You mean, I broke it. Who are you?

???:
You're a human, but you picked me out pretty well from the camo.

Marisa:
You weren't hidden at all. You really stood out.

???:
See you, human! By the way, it's dangerous if you go any further„Éº

Marisa:
Listen when people talk to you.

???:
Hey, it's that human from before. Didn't I tell you not to go any deeper?

Marisa:
Aw geez. Are all the youkai in the mountain like you?

???:
Sorry about that, it's just been so long since I've actually seen a human.
I just wanted to give my new optical camouflage suit a test run.

Marisa:
You want to make me a test subject? What an honour. Please, perform your experiments on me.

???:
Well, anyway, the mountain gets dangerous from here in, so I thought I'd chase you away.
Let me tell you straight up... Turn back now.

Marisa:
Saying that just makes me want to go on all the more.
Doesn't a big "KEEP OUT" sign just make you want to see what's behind it?

Nitori:
No, it doesn't. It doesn't, so just go home.

Marisa:
Seems like everyone's just trying to chase me away. If that's how it is, I'll keep on going as far as I can.

Nitori:
S-strong... to think I'd lose to someone like you...

Marisa:
Now, up the mountain I go.

Nitori:
You're an energetic human. Kappa and humans have been sworn friends since ancient times, so let me tell you something.

Marisa:
For the loser to claim to be a sworn friend is a little strange.

Nitori:
Recently, a threatening god has taken up residence at the top of the mountain.
Thanks to that, us kappa and tengu have been bothered.

Marisa:
What are you saying? You want me to go solve it?

Nitori:
Ah, I've said too much, don't worry about it.

Marisa:
Hmm. From this waterfall the game is on!

???:
Ayayayaya...

Aya:
I came to check on that intruder report, but I never thought it'd be you...

Marisa:
Oh, hey, it's the tengu from back then. Perfect timing. Won't you show me the way in?

Aya:
Too bad for you, I came to chase the intruder away.
I wonder where you wanted me to take you anyway.

Marisa:
You've heard about that strange god that came to live on top of the mountain, right?
I'm the hero that's come to beat her. I'm the hero, going forth with a bang.

Aya:
Ho, I wonder who you heard that from?

Marisa:
Hm, I wonder, I already forgot who it was... Anyway, I want to go see that god.

Aya:
Heheh, I'd love to let you have your way...

Aya:
But there's no way I can let you through.
The tengu patrollers won't stand for it if I let you through that easily.

Marisa:
Why not? It'll be fine, those tengu won't bother me.

Aya:
I have orders from the boss not to let you pass.
Belonging to a group means that sometimes, you don't get to have your way.
Now, I'll go easy on you, So come at me with all your might!

Marisa:
Hey, no need to talk about going easy on me. You will forfeit according to the script anyway.

Aya:
I don't have to fight seriously that much, but you were stronger than I expected.
At this rate, maybe you could even beat that pain of a god.

Marisa:
Don't worry, I'll take care of her for you.
But what is that god doing that's gotten all you tengu and kappa to hate her so much?

Aya:
...Kappa? You heard it from a kappa, didn't you?
To put it simply, she acts like the mountain is hers, which is a pain to those of us who've been here all this while.

Marisa:
What are you talking about? Aren't you tengu the ones who just decided the mountain theirs?
Humans don't go near the mountain thanks to you.

Aya:
Even so, can't the newcomer at least show us some respect?

Marisa:
Yeah, maybe. Well, whatever. Now, time to take me to where she is.

???:
What's the meaning of you storming into my shrine like this!

Marisa:
A shrine!? On top of the mountain? Well, I guess it's got that atmosphere...

???:
This is the Moriya Shrine, a long-forgotten shrine of the past.
It was moved into Gensokyo from the outside world together with the lake.

Marisa:
Who are you? Wait... are you a shrine maiden?

Sanae:
I'm Sanae, a wind priestess, descendent of a long-forgotten line of gods incarnate in the outside world.
Well, I guess you could call me something like a shrine maiden.

Marisa:
Oh, so "shrine maiden" is actually the name of a job... I almost thought it meant "Reimu".

Sanae:
So then, who are you? You don't look like a pilgrim to the shrine...

Marisa:
I'm the magician, Marisa. I'm the hero at the foot of the mountain, come to beat up the evil god.
We also take care of kappa and tengu. We're an anything-goes kind of shop.

Sanae:
There sure are strange people at the foot of the mountain. So, are you going to punish me, as well?

Marisa:
I sure am. You look like an evil god to me.

Sanae:
Well, that's okay. Why don't I do the punishing, instead?

Marisa:
What are you talking about? I'm punishing you. Who are you going to punish?

Sanae:
Why, you, of course. I'll punish you with the power of a living god...
With the divine power to cause miracles!

Sanae:
You're strong...
Your "anything goes shop" act really threw me. Are you really some sort of hero?

Marisa:
I told you, we're an anything-goes shop. The tengu and the kappa were getting sick of you.

Sanae:
All I wanted was for people to revere this mountain in the name of Lady Yasaka, the goddess of mountains.
I thought that the humans and youkai that lived here would like that...

Marisa:
They don't, so go on, take me to the last boss.

Sanae:
What!? Do you mean to meet with Lady Yasaka?

Marisa:
You've got to scold a god when they act up.

Marisa:
Who'd have thought there'd be such a huge lake on top of the mountain?
Come on out, You oblivious god!

???:
Who doth call for mine presence?

Marisa:
Is it you? That god who acts like the mountain's hers, and that's trying to take over the shrine at the foot of the mountain?
I came to punish you.

???:
......
Heh, how interesting. Gensokyo's humans sure are peculiar.

Marisa:
So, you see, if you don't try hard to get along with the tengu and kappa that live in the mountain‚Äî
Somebody'll get in trouble! For sure.

???:
The mountain itself is me. The mountain is the object of worship of me.
After all, this is the only such magnificent mountain in all of Gensokyo...
I can't help it if those who live here don't have faith in me.

Marisa:
Oh, thinking about leaving Gensokyo?

Kanako:
A god must eliminate all who oppose their struggle for faith, one by one.

Marisa:
Why are you so worried about faith all the time?
Gensokyo doesn't need any gods these days.

Kanako:
Were Gensokyo to completely lose its faith, surely it would be thrown into chaos?
The faithless can never understand the meaning of faith.

Marisa:
I go to a shrine every day, you know.

Kanako:
A shrine that loses its faith is nothing but a simple shack.
Now, you, who goes to such a shack every day‚Äî
Experience this once the raging soul of a god!

Kanako:
Oh, do you mean to go further ahead?
You may not ‚Äî there rests my ever-sleeping friend.

Reimu:
If she's Kanako's friend...
That must mean she's another god.

???:
Who said we're friends?
She selfishly sent my shrine into Gensokyo...
Then she shamelessly said, "Oh! Don't worry, it'll be okay".
That kind of woman is an enemy. An enemy!

Reimu:
Isn't this shrine Kanako's?

Suwako:
Auuuuu... Well, it used to be my shrine, you know?

Reimu:
Used to?

Suwako:
A long time ago, I got beaten by Kanako, so now it's her shrine. Can't help that.
But you know what, I'm free to stay around the shrine, and people's faith in me has risen.
It's not like I'm not grateful, I guess...
Anyway, what is it? You're the shrine maiden from down below the mountain, right?

Reimu:
Well, ah, I came to find out the secrets of this shrine.
It looks like you're on pretty good terms with those two, so I think I'll be going back now.

Suwako:
What are you saying? You got to play with Sanae and Kanako, right?
Do you think you'd be fit to be a shrine maiden if you ignored only me?

Reimu:
Well, yes.

Suwako:
Geez! You're a shrine maiden, so you should know this!
"Omatsuri" are another way of saying "kami asobi", which means it's a time when gods play with humans!

Reimu:
Don't tell me, those battles with Sanae and Kanako were...

Suwako:
Yep, just a little god play, or festivals. Today it's my turn to have a danmaku festival!

Suwako:
Ahahahaha. Simply admirable for a human to defeat a god who's built up a country by herself.

Reimu:
What was all that about a festival? Isn't this just normal danmaku play?

Suwako:
Like I said, festivals are a time for gods to play. They're special days where you leave all your everyday cares behind!

Reimu:
Hmmm, but danmaku is an everyday thing...

Suwako:
If the humans that live here are this strong, maybe it's not so bad to live in Gensokyo.

Reimu:
Oh my, I wonder if I overdid it?

Suwako:
I've already decided to stay here.
Oh yes, wouldn't it be great if we start having festivals at your shrine?
If we did that, I bet a lot of people would come.

Reimu:
A danmaku festival? I wonder if anyone would really come.

Suwako:
If they would, Sunday would be nice to have an annual grand festival.

Reimu:
I suppose...
I know a little more about the secrets of this shrine now, so I'm going home for today, okay?

Suwako:
If you don't get more visitors, or if Kanako does anything strange...
Come see me about it, okay?

Reimu:
Okay, okay.

Suwako:
After all, Kanako's faith and divine virtues are mostly thanks to me.

Reimu:
What did you just...?

Suwako:
I provide the divine services. I guess you could say that Kanako does the sales.

Reimu:
The world of the gods is a tough place, isn't it...?

Kanako:
Oh, do you mean to go further ahead?
You may not ‚Äî there rests my ever-sleeping friend.

Marisa:
Kanako said it on the way in...
I knew it! There really is another god in this shrine.

???:
Well, look at this! What a surprise.
It's been a while since Kanako let a human into the inner sanctum.

Marisa:
Uh, well, it's more like I let myself in... Who are you?

Suwako:
I'm the real god of this shrine.

Marisa:
The real one? It looks like things are getting all muddled again...

Suwako:
Outwardly it's Kanako's shrine, but in truth it's mine.
My name isn't really mentioned publicly, but I'm the one that does the work at the shrine.

Marisa:
But, that's...
In other words, Kanako's making off with all the fruits of your labor?

Suwako:
Geh.

Marisa:
If you're giving up the shrine so freely, you must have gotten something really nice in return.

Suwako:
That's not it. This was originally my shrine.
But it's just that a long time ago, Kanako started up a vicious war against me and took over it.

Marisa:
She took over it?

Suwako:
Well, faith in me has risen since then, so I guess I'm grateful for that, but...

Marisa:
The world of the gods sure seems tough.
Welp, now that I know more about the secrets of the shrine, I guess I'll just be...

Suwako:
What are you saying?
I can't just let a visitor leave just like that after coming all the way to the inner sanctum, can I?

Marisa:
Oh, do you have a present for me?

Suwako:
Since you made it into the shrine, you'll have to do like you did with Sanae and Kanako...
You'll have to have a danmaku festival with me!

Suwako:
Ahahahaha. Simply admirable for a human to defeat a god who's built up a country by herself.

Marisa:
I'm your senior when it comes to danmaku, so there's no way I could lose.

Suwako:
For a human to be on the same level as a god in danmaku play...
Gensokyo sure has some pretty sharp people.

Marisa:
That's basically because everyone's really smart. Well, almost everyone.

Suwako:
Alright, It's settled! I'll take up residence in Gensokyo, too.

Marisa:
Isn't that why you came here in the first place, or were you still thinking about going back?

Suwako:
Oh, Kanako moved the shrine here on her own, that's all.

Marisa:
Oh, really?

Suwako:
But, Kanako must have been able to see it...
That a second life awaits us gods here in Gensokyo.

Marisa:
Hey now, it wouldn't be any good if all the gods from the outside came here, you know?

Suwako:
Gensokyo isn't that big, so I don't think that'd happen.

Marisa:
Well, whatever. If you're going to live here, try preparing for a feast once in a while.
The youkai won't stand for it if you don't. And I won't, either.

Suwako:
Oh, scary.
If that's the case, we'd better start planning a big feast right away. I'll get 44 reeds for rice gruel right away.

Marisa:
A party with rice gruel... the outside world's drinking traditions are pure chaos.

Reimu:
Why did I have to come down to such a soaking wet place?

???:
(... Reimu. Can you hear me?... )

Reimu:
Huh? And now I'm hearing things.

Yukari:
(... I made it so we can talk through your yin-yang orbs.)
(So I can make sure you don't slack off.)

Reimu:
As if!
First of all, you sent me into this cave, which is no place to loaf around.

???:
Oh? A human? How unusual.

Yamame:
Did you come to play underground? They're having a big feast down there now.
They won't turn away anyone, so go have fun.

Yukari:
(..... Reimu.)
(That's an enemy, Reimu. Defeat her.)

Reimu:
Is it really?

Yamame:
Oh, what a warm welcome.

Reimu:
I don't really know if she's an enemy or not...
But I guess the usual thing would be to beat her.

Yamame:
Hey, you self-talking human. You're looking for the power of the youkai who got banished down here, right?

Reimu:
Do I talk to myself that much?

Yukari:
(Are you getting tired?)

Reimu:
Of course I'm getting tired. It's not like I want to be down here, anyway.

Reimu:
Just how far does this hole go!?

Yukari:
(... you're almost there.)
(You should reach the Former Capital soon.)

???:
Oh, are you a human?
What does a human want in the Former Capital?

Reimu:
Former Capital?

Parsee:
Are you coming to look for our cursed power?

Yukari:
(...... Reimu.)
(All the youkai underground have fearsome, detestable powers... )
(Just beat her while you're passing by her.)

Reimu:
I can never tell what you're going to say next!
I just wanted to relax in some hot springs. I think you tricked me, Yukari.

Yukari:
(Hmhmhm, I'm not tricking anyone.)

Parsee:
I'm jealous of the light above ground. I'm jealous of the gentle breezes.
I don't have anything against you, but I can make up lots of reasons to attack you.

Reimu:
What was her problem?

Yukari:
(She is a youkai of jealousy binding this world to the next through her regrets.)

Reimu:
This world and the next?
Aren't there too many people who can go back and forth between the two? Reapers, ghosts, and...

Yukari:
(That's just because human death has a bewitching effect on youkai.)

???:
Hey, you're pretty good.
Dunno who you are, but they say a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

???:
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so keep following until you can't take anymore!

Reimu:
But I don't want to go drinking with you.

Reimu:
Geez! Quit wandering around in front of me, you're in the way!

???:
Oh, you're so cold. And people from above almost never come down here.

Yukari:
(... Reimu, why don't we listen to what she has to say?)

Reimu:
I don't even know what we're down here for. You're after something, right, Yukari?

Yuugi:
Just whose tail are you after, anyway?

Reimu:
I don't know.

Yuugi:
Oh, are you lost? How did you wander all the way down here?
Did you wander into some hole that opened up?

Reimu:
Whatever! I was forced to come down here!

Yuugi:
Huh?

Yukari:
(I promised not to let any youkai from above down here.)
(And then you all built a great city underground.)
(But, in return I believe you promised to make sure the vengeful spirits underground would remain pacified.)

Yuugi:
Yeah, we have a deal like that, but who are you if you know about that?

Yukari:
(And yet, the vengeful spirits started pouring out when that geyser erupted. That's not what you promised, is it?)

Yuugi:
Huh? They're pouring out? The vengeful spirits?
Well, I can't think of Many people who've left the Former Capital to go above ground...
I only know of one, But she's...

Yukari:
(She's got nothing to do with this, I'm sure. Can you remember any other times?)

Yuugi:
Hm, let's see... A geyser probably means it's the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

Reimu:
Stop leading the conversation by yourself. What's the Palace of the Earth Spirits? Can we go there?

Yuugi:
You came here because the youkai in that jewel told you to, right?

Reimu:
Yep, you got it right on.

Yuugi:
The Palace of the Earth Spirits is a building right in the middle of what used to be Hell here.
A bunch of stuck-up folks live there.

Reimu:
Hmm. I guess we should go there, then.

Yukari:
(Hohoho, I think it'll be a while before we can set out, as long as she's there, anyway.)

Reimu:
Hm?

Yuugi:
That youkai in the jewel knows what's going on!
Because, we oni always want to compare our strength to strong people we meet!

Yuugi:
Well done!
If you're that powerful, you'll have no problems at the Palace of the Earth Spirits!

Reimu:
What? You're an oni?

Yuugi:
Uh, yeah? We cast aside the above ground world and moved here.
Long ago, this was Hell's shopping district, but now the Yamas have made off with Hell, so...
Now it's just a forgotten prison for vengeful spirits.
Well, that's an old story, I'm sure humans don't remember anymore.

Yukari:
(I wouldn't have thought you oni would break your promise. Now, take her to the Palace of the Earth Spirits.)

Reimu:
Yukari, you're not hiding something, are you?

Yukari:
(Oh, the tea at the shrine wasn't very good.)

Reimu:
Don't drink it all while I'm gone!

Reimu:
I know we took that oni at her word and came to this huge mansion, but
I don't see anyone who looks like they'd be in charge.
... there was that cat, though.

Yukari:
(Hmm.)
(We should have had that cat take us to its master.)

Reimu:
I wish we could have finished off that cat. It might have been attracted by the smell of dead bodies.

???:
... visitors? How unusual.
... I see, my cat must have caused you some trouble.

Reimu:
Finally, someone that looks like a youkai.
There's a lot I want to ask you...

???:
You don't have to tell me that.
...... a strange geyser near a shrine? ...... oh, I think that would be fine, too.
...... Hmm? You're thirsty? Why don't I put on some tea?

Reimu:
Huh? What are you talking to yourself about?
I've been hot for some reason for a while ... so yes, I'm thirsty
but if you're talking about making tea are you a servant, or what?

Satori:
Oh, excuse me. I'm Satori the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
There's nothing that's hidden from me. 
That's because I can hear everything you're thinking...

Reimu:
What!? I guess we don't need to talk then. Some tea would be nice, right away, please!

Yukari:
(...... Reimu, I told you before, didn't I?)
(You should beat any youkai you encounter underground right away.)

Reimu:
Oh well. I still don't know anything about the vengeful spirits.

Satori:
Who are you talking to?
... I see, a youkai that's above ground.
... ...
... I knew it, above ground is too far away, so I can't read her heart.

Yukari:
(I wonder if you're the one who could stop that dreadful geyser?)

Satori:
A geyser? Hm, a geyser... I wonder if one of my pets did something they shouldn't have again?

Yukari:
(Pet? Oh, like that cat?)

Satori:
But, it seems that human doesn't mind if the geyser stays.

Yukari:
(Reimu... you should really get around to taking care of her.)

Reimu:
Mmm. I guess.

Satori:
Yes, she's thinking, "Being down here is a pain, so I'll just beat everyone and go home."

Reimu:
Exactly. We really don't need to talk, do we!?

Satori:
The geyser was probably caused by one of my pets or one of the spirits in this mansion.
I don't mind looking into it, but...
You don't seem to be of a mind to settle this peacefully.

Reimu:
Of course not. Who would take a youkai at their word?

Satori:
But, you trusted that oni... And you're relying on that youkai from above.
I know everything you remember about that youkai, too.
Now, arm your heart, and do battle against your own feelings!

Satori:
Now, this is where it really begins!
Go and sleep with a trauma so frightful it will wake you up!

Satori:
Oh my. Well, you did manage to come this deep underground~

Reimu:
Hm, those danmaku look awfully familiar.

Satori:
Of course, they're danmaku that stood out in your heart. I just imitated them...

Yukari:
(In any case, why don't you tell Reimu about what's in your heart now?)

Satori:
Hmm, how to stop the geyser, was it? You should talk to my pet, then.

Reimu:
You mean that cat? I think we met before...

Satori:
The cat isn't that powerful. I have lots of pets here.
In the courtyard of this mansion, there's a hole that leads to the deepest part of the underground.
She should be there.
... Hm? "If she's your pet, why not just call her?"
My pet has been avoiding me lately. I wonder if it's because of my power?

Reimu:
I don't think anyone likes her, not just her pets. Nobody would get to finish their sentences.

Reimu:
Oh, it's so hot. I wish I hadn't worn winter clothes.

Yukari:
(Those are winter clothes?)

Reimu:
I wouldn't have imagined such a hellish place would be under their courtyard.

Reimu:
... a cat?
I think that cat's been following me from the Palace, how creepy.

Yukari:
(Do you have any catnip?)

???:
Tada~
Looks like you're havin' fun, sis! Mind if I join ya?

Reimu:
Aah! The cat turned into a cat!

Yukari:
(You mean, the cat turned into a cat-wheelbarrow?)

Rin:
It's more fun being a cat, but I can't really talk like that.
Besides, it looked like I was gonna lose to ya, so I had to change back.

Reimu:
Are you the pet Satori was talking about?

Yukari:
(I think she said it wasn't the cat.)

Rin:
I was watching, and listening. To my master's gallantry, and your plot!
You wanna stop the geyser? Ya better not!
She's really dangerous, ya know? She's the most dangerous bird underground.

Reimu:
There's no way we can turn back now! Even if you're a dangerous cat.

Yukari:
(Hm, I wonder where our cat went off to? It's such a pain when she just suddenly disappears like that.)
(I wish you'd take care to program your own familiar properly. Without any bugs.)

Rin:
Well, if you're gonna go up against that dangerous bird, you gotta fight me first!

Reimu:
Perfect! I think we already fought you a few times as a cat, though...

Rin:
If I kill you, human, my hellfire cart will get heavy~‚ô™ Man, carrying off corpses is fun!

Rin:
Good job! Wouldn't've thought I'd lose to a human.

Reimu:
Oh, it's so hot I can't stand it
I just wanted to be done with it.

Rin:
Hey, sis, I bet you can beat her for me! I'll be waiting for you!

Reimu:
What a weird feeling.

Yukari:
(It looks like there's only one road up ahead. All we can do is go forward.)

Reimu:
I wonder what the pet down that road will be like?

Rin:
She's one of Miss Satori's pets, just like me, but...
She got really powerful lately, it's like she can do anything. So, nobody can really take care of her...
We animals get really powerful when we live long, and we can get powerful by swallowing up vengeful spirits and the like
But, she's... I wonder where she found it? Hard to believe she swallowed up the power of the gods.

Yukari:
(Did you hear that?)

Reimu:
Yes. I wonder if gods are easy to digest...

Rin:
Oh yeah, I forgot something.

Reimu:
?

Rin:
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

Reimu:
I can't take it anymore!
I'm going to be burned to death before we ever find that bird. I'm turning into a fried shrine maiden here.

Yukari:
(Don't worry, I'm sure we're about to find her.)

Reimu:
I have no idea what makes you say that but I think you're right.

???:
I finally found you!
You're the weird person from above everyone's been talking about, right?
I heard you were coming to find me but I couldn't find you anywhere.

Reimu:
Hm, speak of the devil, eh?
I guess my intuition is as good as ever.

???:
You're trying to stop the geyser, right?

Reimu:
Uh... right.
Though, I wouldn't mind it if the geyser stayed and only those spirits went away...

???:
You came all the way down here from above ground, so I hate to tell you this, but...
The geyser won't stop. It's too late for that.

Yukari:
(What did you say?)

???:
The geyser is just a hole to let the excess part of my ultimate power escape.

Utsuho:
I've already obtained the ultimate power.
Every time I use it, the geyser gushes forth. So, I can't stop it.

Reimu:
The ultimate power? If a geyser happens every time, does that mean it's the power of a teakettle?

Yukari:
(Reimu, you should be able to see it.
Which god did that bird eat up?)

Reimu:
Hmmmm... the kind that can draw a hot bath? Who knows?
Anyway, we came all this way, so if we just beat her the geyser should stop.

Utsuho:
Hahaha, I guess it comes to that, after all!
Once I beat you, I'm going to go above ground to test out this power of mine.
Hohoho, that pathetic place will be reborn as a new Blazing Hell.

Reimu:
Hm, it's a good thing you ran into me before you went up there.
You'll be beaten by the power of the ultimate shrine maiden, which will stop your invasion plans.

Utsuho:
Lord Yatagarasu, the Black Sun. Thank you for giving me your power.
The sunlight that rains down on the Earth is a nuclear furnace that will create new atoms.
My ultimate nuclear fusion will burn up every body, heart, phantom, and fairy!

Reimu:
Why did I have to come down to such a soaking wet place?

???:
(... heeellooo...)

Reimu:
Huh? And now I'm hearing things.

Suika:
(Oh, hey, you can hear me. We can talk using your yin-yang orbs.)
(Yukari set them up!)

Reimu:
Huh, annoying little orbs.
So, now what? Are you supposed to watch everything I do?

???:
Oh? A human? How unusual.

Yamame:
Did you come to play underground? They're having a big feast down there now.
They won't turn away anyone, so go have fun.

Suika:
(... I've got this TV and this cell phone-type thing Yukari came by with)
(... so, uh, what's a cell phone?)

Reimu:
Are you paying attention? Some living enemy arthropod is standing right in front of us.
If you're just going to make small talk, don't say anything, okay?

Yamame:
You sure talk to yourself a lot, human. Is it stress?

Suika:
(... oh, an earth spider! How nostalgic.)

Yamame:
I'm nostalgic? Who are you?
Well, whatever. You look suspicious, so I'll just beat you, now.

Reimu:
So, what's so nostalgic?

Suika:
(... Zzz... Zzz )

Reimu:
Is she asleep? Did she get hungry?

Reimu:
Just how far does this hole go!?

Suika:
(...... are we there yet?)

Reimu:
How should I know? I don't even really know where we're going.

???:
Could you be a human?
What business does a human have in the Former Capital?

Reimu:
Former Capital?

Parsee:
Don't tell me you're here for our cursed power?

Suika:
(No way, who cares about that?)
(Are you the bridge princess?)

Parsee:
You know about me? Who are you?

Reimu:
I don't know anything about you!

Suika:
(She's a lowly youkai driven by jealousy. Are you guarding the bridge to the underground here?)

Parsee:
Hmph, Are you looking down on me?
That lowly power should still be frightening to a human.

Reimu:
Look, I don't know anything about you, okay?

Parsee:
Then experience the power of a youkai of fear that should have been sealed away.

Reimu:
Stop holding your own conversations!

Suika:
(We're almost there.)

Reimu:
Huh? We're almost where?

Suika:
(The world where we live.)

Reimu:
Whaa? Where the heck are we going?

???:
Hey, you're pretty good.
Dunno who you are, but they say a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

???:
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so keep following until you can't take anymore!

Reimu:
But I don't want to go drinking with you.

Reimu:
Geez! Quit wandering around in front of me, you're in the way!

???:
Oh, you're so cold. And people from above almost never come down here.

Suika:
(Oh, I was wondering who that was! Yuugi, long time no see.)

???:
Huh? You know who I am? ...... Who are you?

Suika:
(Me, it's me! Don't tell me you forgot me just 'cos I went to play above ground for a little while.)

???:
That drunken voice ... Is that Suika!?

Suika:
(I wanna go mountain climbing again, the four of us.)

Yuugi:
Wow, you sure have changed a lot... You look just like a human shrine maiden.
When did you pick up those tastes, anyway?

Reimu:
How should I know?
You're not talking to me.

???:
Huh? Where'd Suika go?

Reimu:
She's above ground. Wait, do you know her?

???:
Above ground? Oh, her voice is coming from that jewel.

Reimu:
If you're friends, you're an oni too, right?

Yuugi:
Of course. I was one of the Big Four of the Mountain with Suika, Yuugi the Strong!
Of course, I can't climb many mountains down here.

Reimu:
Hmm. So, you're not trying to attack the overworld, are you?

Yuugi:
Ahahahaha! Why would we want to do that now?
This place may have been Hell once, but now it's our paradise.
We're even thankful for the sages above ground. They won't let anyone come bother us here.
But more importantly, you!
You're strong for a human, And it looks like you know Suika, too.
I haven't been this excited in a long time!

Reimu:
... why am I always surrounded by people like this?

Yuugi:
Well done!
Only a friend of Suika could be this strong!

Reimu:
So, you really don't want to attack the overworld?

Yuugi:
No way. That's an oni's promise.
The underworld was given to us in return for sealing away the vengeful spirits.
The underworld is our paradise. We don't care about the overworld anymore.

Suika:
(It's been weird lately, though. The vengeful spirits showed up together with these springs.)

Yuugi:
Oh, Suika. So, the vengeful spirits, you say?

Suika:
(Yep, together with a bunch of earth spirits. Something bad's gonna happen if this keeps up.)

Yuugi:
... really? That's weird, someone should be watching over them.

Reimu:
What are you talking about? I haven't gotten the explanation about these vengeful spirits.

Suika:
(That's 'cos nobody's given one.)
(Anyway, I asked this human to look into it for me.)
(Since we can't act in secret.)

Yuugi:
Oh, I see! Well, then, I'll leave it to you, human!

Reimu:
But I have no idea where to go or what to investigate„Éº

Reimu:
So, does that mean there are enemies in this mansion that can control the vengeful spirits?

Suika:
(Yeah, probably.)

Reimu:
Well, we just snuck in... Oh well, it looks like a youkai den, so it's probably okay.

Suika:
(This is the mansion of the most hated person in the underground. The master of the mansion controls lots of vengeful spirits.)

Reimu:
The most hated person in the underground... They must have a pretty bad personality.

Suika:
(Naw, she acts really grown-up and she's very mild-mannered, but...)

???:
... A visitor? Most unusual.
...... I see, it seems my pet has caused you some trouble.

Reimu:
Oh, are you that hated person?

???:
That's not a very nice way of putting it.
...... hmmm.
...... It seems you're looking for a fight. But it doesn't look like you have a good reason for it.

Reimu:
Oh, you catch on pretty quickly. I definitely don't have a good reason.

???:
...... now you're trying to think of one. ......vengeful spirits, oni? Hot springs? Burglary!?

Reimu:
Hey!
How do you know what I'm...

Satori:
There's nothing you can hide from me.
Perhaps I should have introduced myself sooner. I'm Satori, the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
My third eye will tell me whatever you're thinking, no matter how badly you wish it otherwise.

Reimu:
You can tell what I'm thinking? Gah, people must hate that.

Suika:
(See? Nobody wants to be with her. Welp, good luck.)

Reimu:
Hey, you're the one that came along, aren't you!?
Do something about her!

Satori:
Who on earth are you talking to...?
Oh, I see, there's an oni above ground. I didn't know that.

Suika:
(I knew it, she can't tell what I'm thinking up here. It's so far away, I'm in a safety zone.)

Reimu:
That's not fair. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to beat her before she reads my mind.

Satori:
"The oni will be satisfied if I can beat the master of the Palace." Hmm.
Unfortunately, I don't think anything will change even if you do manage to beat me.

Suika:
(Fighting her for too long is dangerous. Hurry up before she lays your heart bare!)

Satori:
Ah, you're thinking, "Hmm, I wonder if she's really the mastermind?"
What? "Who cares, let's get her anyway!"

Reimu:
I just want to finish up my business here and go back up to the hot spring!

Satori:
It seems you're of no mind to settle this peacefully.
I can see it. The danmaku drawn into your memory!

Satori:
Here's where it really begins!
Now, sleep with this trauma that will leave you sleepless!

Satori:
Not bad at all. I didn't think a human from above would be so strong.

Reimu:
Hmmmm. I think I've seen these danmaku before somewhere...

Suika:
(Hey, hey, those were my moves before! It'd be nice if you'd remember them.)

Satori:
I picked the danmaku that looked the strongest from the depths of your heart.

Reimu:
Eh?

Satori:
Oh, you're remembering even stronger ones now? Hm, I'll have to have another look.

Suika:
(Yeah, just tell her whatever, blah blah blah.)

Reimu:
Blah blah blah blah blah. Like that?

Satori:
There's no need to use words. Ah yes, a geyser that's spewing out vengeful spirits...
One of my pets is in charge of that. I'll take you to the courtyard.

Reimu:
Courtyard?

Satori:
You can go even farther down from there.

Reimu:
Bwuh? I don't want to go any deeper.

Satori:
"It'll take me even farther from the hot springs", you say...

Reimu:
What's with this place? It's way too hot!

Suika:
(Well, the Palace of the Earth Spirits... )
(... was built above the Hell of Blazing Fires when the Former Capital stopped being part of Hell.)
(We came here because we can take care of both the geyser and the vengeful spirits in the Hell of Blazing Fires.)

Reimu:
What, the Hell of Blazing Fires? Is it okay to go any farther down here?

Reimu:
...... it's another cat.
I think that cat's been following us since the Palace of the Earth Spirits. It's kind of creepy.

Suika:
(It's suspicious.)

???:
Tada~
Hey, sis, havin' fun in the Hell of Blazing Fires? The hellfires'll take your body and your soul.

Reimu:
Woah, It wasn't a cat?

Suika:
(No, I think it's cat enough.)

Rin:
A cat's a cat, but don't make the mistake of thinking I'm just your ordinary cat.
I've been living here ever since this place was really Hell.
And now I can catch corpses and spirits and control them. All my hard work has really paid off.

Reimu:
What? Spirits?
That means we'd better take her down, right?

Suika:
(Hey, you're one of those fire chariots, right? Hey, hey!)

Reimu:
Huh? Well, we've got a cart for fires at the shrine, but ..

Rin:
Hey, sis, I'm your fiery cart, right here.
If I find a corpse, I'll wheel it in this cart all the way to Hell!
I'll take your corpse, too!

Rin:
Man, sis, you really did a number on me. Your strength is unbelievable.

Reimu:
What's with her? What a weird cat.
But, anyway, we beat her, so does that mean the geyser will go back to normal?

Rin:
Nope, I'm not in charge of the geyser.

Reimu:
Well, then, take us to whoever is.

Rin:
Hmm, her place is... I think it's at the core of the underground...
Yeah... I can't recommend it for ya. But, maybe someone as strong as you...
Can break her right down‚ô™

Reimu:
Somehow you seem to make me confident and make me uneasy.

Suika:
(It's okay. You can't lose.)

Reimu:
Hey, you. You know lots about the underground, don't you?

Rin:
Hey, no need to worry. I'll take care of your bones and your soul.

Suika:
(If she picks up your corpse, there's no way you'll make it to heaven.)
(You'll wander the underground as a vengeful spirit forever. You can't lose now.)

Reimu:
Oh, whatever. I won't lose whatever happens.

Rin:
Oh yeah, I forgot something.

Reimu:
?

Rin:
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

Reimu:
Ah, I can't take it anymore!
I can't stay in a place like this. My lungs are going to burn up.

Suika:
(Well, it is the deepest part of the Hell of Blazing Fires.)
(Most sinners chose this place as the hell they'd want to go back to the least.)

Reimu:
It must have been terrible long ago. I can't believe anyone would get sent to a place like this after they died now.

???:
Well, I haven't seen a new sinner in a long time.
You must have been pretty thoughtless to be sent to the Hell of Blazing Fires.

Reimu:
It's not like I got sent here. I'm just on a little trip.

Suika:
(This is a hell raven. She's a humble bird that eats the corpses of the dead in the Hell of Blazing Fires.)

Reimu:
She must eat mostly fried meat, then. That'll be bad for her when she's older.

Suika:
(The Remains of Blazing Hell is the source of the geyser and the vengeful spirits.)
(So, I thought we'd come to see what was going on...)
(But, it looks like she's eaten something pretty bad.)

Reimu:
Huh? Something bad?

???:
What are you mumbling on about? Did you come on a trip here to get eaten?

Suika:
(I can feel something that doesn't belong in hell. She's...)
(Probably eaten a god.)

???:
See, your body's getting burned up pretty nicely now.
I want to eat you up right now, but it's not good to rush. You have to let it fry just the right amount for it to taste the best.

Reimu:
Hm, I'll clip your wings before that.
Humans these days aren't scared of any Hell of Blazing Fires, much less the birds that live there.
The birds that eat raw garbage up above are scarier.

Utsuho:
Hohoho. So, you're not afraid of the Hell of Blazing Fires?
Well, then, what about a much more terrifying high temperature, high pressure world?

Suika:
(Aw, man, what an idiot.)

Reimu:
Hm? What's wrong?

Suika:
(The power I can feel inside of her is a Yatagarasu.)

Reimu:
Yatagarasu? A sun crow inside a crow? She's like one of those Russian dolls!

Suika:
(A Yatagarasu is a god that controls the ultimate energy. Reimu, maybe you'd better run.)

Utsuho:
Too bad, but you can't escape from the flaming kettle of hell.
This high temperature, high pressure world that distorts even time will transform the above ground world in a big way.
The ultimate energy is nuclear fusion power! Won't you fuse with me?

Reimu:
Why did I have to come down to such a soaking wet place?

???:
(... ah, ah, ah- It's fine today...)

Reimu:
Bright and sunny? This is the middle of a cave! Er, wait, am I hearing things now?

Aya:
(...... it's me. Pure and Honest Shameimaru.)
(Those yin-yang orbs allow us to communicate.)

Reimu:
Huh, I bet that's her doing. Is this convenient or a pain...?

Aya:
Well, I would like you to reveal the darkness of the underground.

???:
Oh? A ventriloquist?

Yamame:
I wonder where that voice is coming from?

Aya:
(Something weird showed up, eh?)

Reimu:
I can tell you're excited, even when you're talking through the yin-yang orbs.

Aya:
(So excited!)

Yamame:
Hm, is that popular up there now? When you're excited, do you talk to yourself -
Or are you just ignoring people?

Reimu:
Oh, I'm not ignoring you.
I'll take out my anger at having nothing to do on you!

Yamame:
I'll show you how great the power of The youkai who were banished underground is!

Reimu:
Yep, she sure showed me How strong the banished youkai are.

Aya:
(... that was an earth spider. They say if you see them at night, it was let in by a thief.)

Reimu:
I only came down here because you incited me to.
I wonder what's down here in the underground.

Reimu:
Just how far does this hole go!?

Aya:
(... it's deep, isn't it?)
(It can't be good for the above ground world if a hole like this is open to down below.)

???:
Are you worried about above ground because of the earthquakes?
If you came down here to see about that, then you don't know anything about the earthquakes.

Reimu:
Huh? No need to worry about the earthquakes, Not if the shrine's okay.

Parsee:
Really? Hmmm, ummmm, well, whatever.

Aya:
(Did something show up? ...... oh, it's that small fry from before.)
(Are you going to do something interesting?)

Parsee:
Something interesting?
You're the ones that are going to do something interesting, right?

Reimu:
If we were, there's no reason we'd come so deep into a hole like this!
Besides, we can always go see something interesting.

Parsee:
So, you can always go see something interesting? I'm so jealous.
If that's the case, then you need to show me something interesting to relieve my boredom!

Reimu:
I didn't just come down here to get material for your paper.

Aya:
(Well, this is a good opportunity for that, but my purpose is to have you strike down a great evil.)

Reimu:
Why don't you just do it yourself?

Aya:
(There are some things even youkai don't like.)

Reimu:
Humans don't like being underground, either.

???:
Hey, you're pretty good.
Dunno who you are, but they say a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

???:
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so Keep following until you can't take anymore!

Aya:
(Well, this has gotten a bit out of hand.)

Reimu:
Geez! Quit wandering around in front of me, you're in the way!

???:
Oh, you're so cold. And people from above almost never come down here.

Aya:
(Ah, hello, hello. Nice to meet you, I'm Shameimaru the Tengu.)

???:
Huh? A tengu?
I wouldn't have guessed it by looking at you...

Reimu:
No, I'm not a tengu, I'm a human.

???:
Huh? Well, what were you saying before, then?

Aya:
(No, no, I'm a tengu pretending to be a human. There's something I needed to look into...)

Reimu:
Just a-

Aya:
(I didn't think it would be a good idea for a tengu to be down here, but I was able to sneak in like this.)

???:
Hm, strange to think a tengu would come down here...

Yuugi:
I thought you didn't want to meet us, so you were 
avoiding us.

Aya:
(No, no, I thought I'd come introduce myself later.)

Yuugi:
Hmm, and you're pretending to be a human?
You know, I really hate good tengu lies like that.

Aya:
(I'm so very sorry. I didn't mean to come down here to spout lies to you.)

Reimu:
Hm, so did you send me down here because you couldn't move on your own, because there's someone you didn't want to bump into?

Yuugi:
Hoho. Well, since we're such good friends with tengu, I'll look over it this time... but on one condition.

Yuugi:
I only forgive the strong and the brave!

Yuugi:
Well done!
Now, let's see what I'm forgiving such a strong person for!

Aya:
(Heheh. Thank you very much. Well, then, I suppose I'll get straight to the point.)
(Vengeful spirits have begun to appear above ground. Of course, I'm not saying that this is the oni's doing.)

Reimu:
What? Vengeful spirits? That's the first I've heard of this!

Yuugi:
Huh? What's that?

Aya:
(It would be a problem for you, as well, if they were to get out, right?)

Yuugi:
Hmmmm. Well, you're not lying, right?

Aya:
(Why would I be lying? In any case, we wanted to investigate these spirits...)

Yuugi:
I see, well, I'll trust you this time, based on what your strength and this sake tell me.

Aya:
(Hehehe, you're far too kind.)

Reimu:
You two are going to go right along and keep ignoring me, aren't you?

Reimu:
Isn't this place suspicious?

Aya:
(Yes, I can quite clearly smell a dope.)

Reimu:
Hm, the smell reaches all the way up there?
By the way, what were you saying earlier about vengeful spirits?

Aya:
(Ah yes, the spirits... it's quite certain that vengeful spirits were emanating from the geyser...)
(I just used them so that you'll be free to move about the underground.)

Reimu:
Huh?

Aya:
(Well, never you mind... Let's make sure we search every nook and cranny of this mysterious mansion.)

???:
...It's unusually busy here.
How long has it been since we've had visitors in the Palace?

Reimu:
Oh, somebody's there?

???:
I should say I am. It's my house, after all.

Aya:
(Perhaps we should introduce ourselves?)

Reimu:
Oh, hey there, I'm Reimu, the shrine maiden from above ground.

Satori:
I'm Satori, the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
...... hmmm.
You're being awfully cautious of me considering you're the visitor here.

Reimu:
No, I'm not, really.

Aya:
(Your mansion looked so splendid I just wanted to get some information on it...)

Satori:
...... hmm? You're speaking of things that you didn't think of.

Aya:
(Eh?)

Satori:
Nothing can be hidden from me.
What you're thinking speaks volumes beyond anything you could say with your mouth.

Reimu:
What do you mean?

Satori:
... "This is such a pain, maybe I should give up the hot springs."

Reimu:
eek

Satori:
... "How does she know what I'm thinking?"

Reimu:
Yeeek!

Satori:
... "She's creepy, I'd better shut her up", you say?

Reimu:
You mean you can read my mind? I guess I don't have to bother saying anything.

Aya:
(What's this? I can't believe there's a mind-reading youkai...)
(... hm, hm, This should make an interesting article.)

Reimu:
...... griiin.

Satori:
... "Now, how am I going to beat her?"

Reimu:
Go on, read more.

Satori:
... "Hm, how about this danmaku?" ... "Or maybe this one..."

Aya:
(What on earth are you imagining?)

Satori:
Such a foolish human.
You're only spelling out your own defeat, you know.

Satori:
Here's where it really begins.
Now, sleep with this trauma that will leave you sleepless!

Satori:
Well, not bad. I took you too lightly since you're a human from above.

Reimu:
I was wondering who lived in such a big house, but you weren't such a big deal, after all.

Aya:
(Those techniques were...)

Satori:
Why ever did you come so far underground?
There are too many questions in your mind, I can't see what you're after clearly.

Aya:
(Ah, well, that's right. A geyser has appeared above ground, and with it some vengeful spirits.)
(We've asked a few people about it, but so far nobody seems to have been involved.)

Satori:
A geyser? Vengeful spirits?
Hmmm... maybe you've come to the right place after all.

Reimu:
Eh?

Satori:
I think one of my pets could have done something like that.

Aya:
(Pets... you mean like that cat?)

Satori:
If you want to look into it, I'll take you to the courtyard.

Reimu:
Courtyard?

Satori:
You can get farther underground from there. That's where my pet will be.

Reimu:
Well, I've gone too far to turn back. I guess I have no choice.

Satori:
"You didn't have to go say something like that", was it?
Well, I'm sorry for reading your mind.

Reimu:
That cat keeps creeping up on us, but I just can't quite take it down.

Aya:
(Hmm. Perhaps that cat isn't a normal cat?)

Reimu:
Well, I don't think there's any way it could be if it can shoot danmaku.

Aya:
(According to what Miss Satori said, that cat may be holding the key to something.)

Reimu:
Next time it comes I'll get it for sure.

Reimu:
There it is!
This time I won't let you get away!

???:
Speak of the devil and she will appear!
You're pretty strong, Sis. You'd have to be, to beat Miss Satori.

Reimu:
!? It turned into a youkai!

Aya:
(It's a youkai! Let's defeat it! Alright, come out and fight~)

Reimu:
I think things'll get out of hand if you keep telling me that.

Rin:
Hahaha, I turned into a youkai? Humans are a lot rarer down here, ya know.
Well, how 'bout it? Ya said ya wanted to find about the geyser, right?
I heard it before!

Reimu:
Well, straight to the point.

Aya:
(...... hmm. It's... not you, is it?)

Reimu:
?

Rin:
If you're lookin' for the geyser's source, ya gotta go deeper. The meanest bird ever is down there, though.

Reimu:
Bird? So you don't have anything to do with it?

Rin:
But, I can't let ya get down there. Here's where you turn into a wandering spirit.

Rin:
Phew, you're pretty good, Sis! I can't believe there are humans that strong above ground.

Reimu:
Are there even any humans underground?

Rin:
Okay, if you're that strong, ya might even be able to damage her a little.

Reimu:
Is that bird really that strong?

Rin:
We animals get powerful by living really old, or swallowing ghosts and spirits.
I wonder where she found it, though? She was able to swallow the power of a god.
She got really powerful, ya know. Ya better be careful, Sis.

Reimu:
Hmmm. Well, I guess nothing surprises me that much anymore.

Aya:
(The power of a god...? I thought this seemed rather strange.)

Reimu:
It's so hot down here, though. I wish you'd come down here and let me borrow your fan.

Rin:
Oh yeah, I forgot something.

Reimu:
?

Rin:
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left.
If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

Reimu:
Ah, I can't take it anymore!
If you think about it, there's no way we'd be able to find anyone here. It's so hot.

Aya:
(The cat before said it, right? She swallowed up a god's power.)
(Shouldn't we be looking for a place with an atmosphere that fits that?)

Reimu:
Hm, that kind of atmosphere...
But we don't even know what kind of god she's supposed to have eaten.

Aya:
(Actually, I happen to remember a god like that.)

Reimu:
What?

???:
Welcome to the depths of the depths of hell that none should visit.
I heard about you from Orin. She said a human and a youkai that wanted to stop the geyser were coming...
But all I see is a human. Is the youkai invisible?

Reimu:
Hey, someone else turned into a youkai!

Aya:
(Come out and fight!)

???:
Come out and... You're not alone, are you? Maybe there really are two of you.

Reimu:
One person or two, I've got the power of a hundred! Anyway, you said something about the geyser?

Utsuho:
I'm Utsuho, and I'm in charge of guarding the Remains of Blazing Hell. Everyone calls me "Okuu".
Well, about the geyser... Maybe you could have before, but it's too late to stop it now.

Aya:
(This is... I can see power radiating from her body.)
(Are you the one who was tempted into eating that god?)

Reimu:
Hm? What are you talking about?

Aya:
(You're planning on taking over the above ground world, aren't you? And the mountain god talked you into it.)

Utsuho:
Hm? What are you talking about? The mountain god talked me into it?

Aya:
(That's right. She was up to no good, so I took the liberty of looking into it myself.)
(Somehow she brought an incredible power down here, and not long after, the geyser appeared.)

Reimu:
What are you talking about? I don't get it at all.

Utsuho:
Hmhmmm. What of it? I am indeed the one with the power of a god.
I'm also the one who's plotting to invade the above ground using this power.
And, so what? Are you saying you'll try to stop me?

Aya:
(No, no, I guess that depends on whether or not you'll give me exclusive coverage of the invasion.)

Reimu:
Wha-!?

Aya:
("Full coverage! The Hell Crow's Seven Days War" I think I'm on the trail of a huge scoop...)

Reimu:
Now, just a minute! I won't allow that.

Utsuho:
Very well. Will you interview me as much as you like and spread fear of me far and wide?

Reimu:
Oh, is that okay? I guess it would be uncouth of me to try to stop you.
... did you really think I'd say that? You can't just invade the above ground.

Utsuho:
Oh, you have no sense of atmosphere, do you? Beating you will be the first step in my invasion, then.

Aya:
(Hm, Shrine maiden VS Hell crow, here comes another scoop! Come out and fight, all you scoundrels!)

Utsuho:
The divine flames that I've absorbed... will burn you to a crisp with nuclear energy and leave nothing behind!

Marisa:
The wind's pretty strong for the inside of a cave.

???:
(......Marisa? Can you hear me?...)

Marisa:
No, I can't hear you at all. I'm still normal.

Alice:
(... I see. Should I take back my dolls, then?)

Marisa:
Huh, so I can use them to talk to you, not just for attacking.

Alice:
(Yukari prepared them for me.)

???:
Oh? A human? How unusual.

Yamame:
Are you going to the festival they're having down below? You look like it.

Alice:
(Indeed.)

Marisa:
I'm not really interested in the underground.
I mean, we'd finally gotten a hot spring up there.
Why do I have to come to such a wet and gloomy place all of a sudden?

Alice:
(We'd be in trouble if you hadn't come.)
(After all, we can't make a move down there.)

Yamame:
What are you mumbling about?

Marisa:
Just talking to myself about how to beat you.

Yamame:
It looks like you're not that friendly of a visitor.

Marisa:
See, all we've done is beat up someone completely unrelated.

Alice:
(Isn't that what you always do? Just stop complaining and hurry on further down.)

Marisa:
Well, I guess it is what I always do.

Marisa:
How many floors to go until we're underground?

Alice:
(There aren't any "floors" in a cave.)

Marisa:
Really? I thought places like dungeons always had floors.

Parsee:
You're now on floor B666.

Parsee:
Welcome to the end of the underground skyscraper.

Marisa:
See? I told you there were floors. It'd be hard to tell how far you'd gone if there weren't.

Alice:
(I'm sure you could tell based on how much time you'd spent.)
(But, there's an enemy here, right?)

Marisa:
Yeah, yeah, I'll beat her up now.

Parsee:
A human going to the Former Capital who talks to herself a lot... Are you crazy?

Marisa:
Hey, didn't we just bump into you before?
That means you're the boss of the dungeon, right?

Alice:
(Yes, she's the boss.)

Parsee:
I wouldn't recommend that you treat going underground like a game.
You might be trying to get experience points, but you'll just be wasting time in the end.

Marisa:
Yeah, I guess I've been wasting time. I didn't get much at all for that.

Alice:
(H-, hurry up. We're almost to our destination.)

Marisa:
Oh? Finally... Wait, where were we going?

Alice:
(The Former Capital where the sealed-away youkai live.)

Marisa:
Hm. It's nice that the dungeon was so short.

???:
Hey, you're pretty good.
No idea who you are, but they say a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

???:
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so Keep following until you can't take anymore!

Marisa:
Oh? I don't really want to follow you, but...

Marisa:
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you...

???:
Hm? What's that? Give up already?

Marisa:
No, uh, this is the underground world, right?
So, why is it snowing down here...?

???:
Huh? Well, it's winter, of course it's snowing.

Marisa:
Oh, of course!

Alice:
(Marisa, we've made it to the city, so let's try to get some information.)

Marisa:
Hm, okay, let's talk, then. Who are you?

Yuugi:
I'm one of the Big Four of the Mountain, Yuugi the strong.
Of course, I can't really go mountain climbing since I came underground.

Alice:
(Big Four...? Of the Mountain...??)

Marisa:
Okay, question time is over. That's how it is talking to people in town.

Yuugi:
Pretty straightforward. Mind if I ask something?

Marisa:
Go ahead.

Yuugi:
It's really been a long time since humans came underground.
That's because there's a lot of really frightening youkai here. Humans always seemed scared of them.
So, then, are you brave? Or are you a fool?

Marisa:
I'm a merchant.

Alice:
(You mean a thief, right?)

Yuugi:
Ho ho. I guess it's a waste of time to ask a fool a question.
If you were strong, I probably wouldn't need to say anything, No matter why you came down here.

Alice:
(Marisa, watch out! I did some research, and the Big Four of the Mountain are...)

Yuugi:
Alright, come on and fight me seriously! If you don't, you might end up in tears!

Yuugi:
Well done!
I love how strong you are! We're friends from now on.

Alice:
(The Big Four of the Mountain are the four big oni, if we're talking about the Youkai Mountain.)
(Which would mean you're looking at an oni...)

Marisa:
An oni...? You mean, like Suika?

Yuugi:
So, why did you come down here?

Marisa:
I have no idea, myself...

Alice:
(I've got something to ask you. I'd like you to stop the geyser that's erupting now.)
(I can feel something sinister behind it all. Above all...)
(My dolls go out of control when they get near it. It's as if they've got some sort of grudge...)

Yuugi:
A geyser, huh? That's odd, I have no idea about that either...
You should probably go to the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
They might know something up there.

Marisa:
Hey, you're finally acting like a townsperson. But...
What's with you, Alice? You sent me down here to try to stop the hot springs?

Alice:
(That's right. I thought you'd object if I mentioned it, so I didn't tell you.)

Marisa:
Well, I guess if I've come this far, I'll go to that Palace of the Earth Spirits or whatever and make those springs gush forth!

Marisa:
And here the last dungeon comes to a finale.

Alice:
(That's right, are you prepared for it?)

Marisa:
Ah, I should have done some shopping in the town back there.

Alice:
(But, it doesn't look like there are any townsfolk here. ......There was a cat, though.)

Marisa:
It's all good. Searching a house with nobody in it is the basic of basics.

???:
......Who is it?
A human......? I can't believe a human could make it all the way down here.

Marisa:
It's all good. Searching a house with somebody in it is also the basic of basics.

Alice:
(Why don't you listen to what she has to say?)

Marisa:
Aah, well, I want the hot spring to gush more. What should I do?

???:
...What you are saying is the opposite of what you are thinking.

Marisa:
Huh?

???:
Now you're starting to have questions about the gushing hot spring.

Marisa:
What do you mean...?

Satori:
I'm Satori, the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
No one can hide anything from me. Your heart is in plain sight to me.

Marisa:
......Huh? What the heck?

Alice:
(......A satori! She's a youkai exiled from the surface.)
(She has an extremely dangerous ability, mind reading. There's no way you can win.)

Marisa:
Yuck, I don't like this.

Alice:
(I can't believe we were led here just by investigating that geyser.)
(Perhaps the oni back there tricked us?)

Marisa:
I didn't think oni were such liars, though... Maybe she knows something?

Satori:
..."Mind reading, that sounds like a lie."

Marisa:
Oh?!

Satori:
......"Anyway, everything'll be fine if I beat her, right?" I see.
......"What a pain, let's just fight." I see. How belligerent.

Alice:
(Marisa... You....)

Marisa:
Don't worry. Seems like she can really read minds, though.
Right now, I'm not thinking about anything else but fighting her!

Satori:
Hm, I can see it. My mind-reading third eye will show me your very heart!
An image of battle... I think I can use this to make you suffer.

Satori:
Here I come. From now on it's the real thing!
Sleep with the trauma that always wakes you up!

Satori:
You're pretty strong, But you didn't come here to beat me.

Marisa:
If you can read minds, then there's no need to lie.
Oh, that's right! I came to discover the secrets of the geyser!
And then that oni told me to come to this mansion...

Satori:
You should have said that from the beginning. I wouldn't have had to fight you...
... If a geyser is causing you trouble, then it's probably my pet's doing.

Alice:
(Your pet? You mean the cat we saw before?)

Satori:
If you want to find out more, I'll open the courtyard for you.

Marisa:
The courtyard? Your pet is there, right?

Satori:
No, the courtyard has a hole that leads down to the depths of the underworld.

Marisa:
Hey, so I guess this place isn't the last dungeon?

Alice:
(We still have a long way to go. Let's go the depths of the underworld. Hang in there.)

Satori:
"Before that, let's search the house...." you think.
I won't allow that. Please head to the courtyard immediately.

Marisa:
Damn.

Marisa:
Whew... This is so hot. So hot I could die!

Alice:
(Are the dolls okay?)

Marisa:
Yeah, but it's so hot I wouldn't be surprised if they burned up.

Alice:
(I think the dolls themselves will be fine, but it would be bad if the gunpowder inside caught fire.)

Marisa:
Why the hell did you stuff gunpowder in 'em?

Marisa:
......it's that cat again.

Alice:
(Marisa, are you throwing around some kind of cat food?)

Marisa:
Maybe it wants to play with these dolls?

???:
Tada~
Sis, you're pretty strong. You even beat Miss Satori.

Marisa:
Ooh, here she comes! A boss, out of the blue.

Alice:
(It wasn't exactly out of the blue, actually......)

Rin:
So, sis, you're investigating the geyser, right? I saw ya goin' back and forth with Miss Satori!

Marisa:
That must have been the last dungeon's mid-boss, I guess.

Alice:
(No, she said the geyser was her pet's doing.)
(Is this girl the last boss?)

Rin:
Too bad! The geyser's not my territory.
I just followed you because you're strong.

Marisa:
She said it's not her. Why don't we go? I'm wasting my energy, here.

Alice:
(Well, I wonder what kind of youkai she is...)

Rin:
Leave your corpses and vengeful spirits to me! Shipping dead bodies to hell, Orin's wheelbarrow transport at your service.
In this Blazing Hell, we'll grow your corpse and spirit
into a really great vengeful spirit!

Rin:
Aww, you sure did it, sis. I'm really moved!

Alice:
(Vengeful spirits? We don't hear about them often, do we?)

Marisa:
There aren't many vengeful spirits on the surface. How are they different from phantoms?

Rin:
A vengeful spirit is a ghost that came into being because of a grudge.
If one possesses a human or a youkai, the possessed will come to hold a grudge against the world.

Alice:
(Will come to hold a grudge against world? Then, maybe the geyser incident...)
(And my dolls going crazy near the geyser is ... because of the vengeful spirits?)

Marisa:
What?

Alice:
(Vengeful spirits are coming from the geyser, right? If that's the case, then I'm satisfied with this explanation.)

Marisa:
That's dangerous. So, let's depart on an adventure to stop the geyser!
Oops, it's already the last stage. Never mind that excitement, then.

Rin:
Sis, you're going to stop the geyser, right?
You'd better give up. The one that controls geysers is deadly.

Alice:
(Hahaha, then she must be the real last boss. We were told not to do it by the townspeople, too.)

Marisa:
Right, well, let's go settle it then! The last battle is right before our eyes!

Rin:
I see, so you're gonna go on anyway.
Do your best, 'cause remember, I'll be there to pick up your bones, Big Sis Strong Corpse.

Rin:
Oh right, I forgot to tell you one thing.

Marisa:
?

Rin:
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left. If I want your corpse,
I'd better take you down here!

Marisa:
I think I'm sweating so much I'm losing weight.

Alice:
(You have to take care of your own body. It's a given for us magic users.)

Marisa:
Well, since I'm a thief, I can definitely say that there's no treasure to be found around here.

???:
What are you trying to find......
Miss human, which I have not seen for a long time.

Marisa:
Here she is! I've got the feeling she's the big boss this time.

Alice:
(Oh, my, I wonder if this bird is Satori's pet?)

???:
......you met Miss Satori, didn't you?

Alice:
(Yes, she said her pet was responsible for the geyser.)

Utsuho:
Indeed, I'm Utsuho, the administrator of the Blazing Hell's heating power.
The geyser is merely its byproduct, but...... What's wrong with it?

Marisa:
I want you to stop it 'cause it's dangerous.

Utsuho:
......The geyser shouldn't be that dangerous. At most, you can only get burnt by it.

Alice:
(Well, something is gushing out with hot water! Vengeful spirits or something else.)

Utsuho:
Vengeful spirits......? That's weird. Vengeful spirits should be under Orin's control.
I'm not responsible for the vengeful spirit matter. Plus, the geyser cannot be stopped now.

Marisa:
What?

Utsuho:
I have just obtained an exceedingly strong power, and the flame of the Blazing Hell became stronger as a result.
So geysers became stronger as well.

Marisa:
Strong power?

Utsuho:
Yes. The ultimate power The energy to melt up every corner of the surface.

Alice:
(What are you talking about? There's no such power.)

Marisa:
Hm, that's right. And the geyser can definitely be stopped.
If I send both you and your power to oblivion, the geyser will stop.

Utsuho:
Oh, that was certainly a point I overlooked. If I'm no longer of this world, then the Blazing Hell will return to the way it was.
But, there's also another point you are overlooking.
My ultimate nuclear energy melts up everything completely! How would you go about taking me down then?

Marisa:
The wind's pretty strong for the inside of a cave.

???:
(...... that's because this great wind hole is here.)

Marisa:
...... hm, my ears are ringing.

Patchouli:
... you can hear my voice, right?)

Marisa:
What's that? Where's your voice coming from?

Patchouli:
(From all those little things around you...)

???:
Oh? A human? How unusual.
Are you going to the festival they're having down below? You look like it.

Patchouli:
(Be careful. The youkai underground are different from us.)

Marisa:
What? They look about the same...

Yamame:
Well, if you're gonna go, go, or else go back.
It'll be harder for you if I have to get involved.

Patchouli:
(The youkai underground are bad for you.)

Marisa:
Whaat? It's not like I'm going to eat her?

Yamame:
I'm bad for you even if you don't eat me.
Well, I haven't punished a human with diseases in a long time, I may as well have some fun.

Marisa:
Wow, you're right. She seems pretty bad for me.

Patchouli:
(The underground is full of despised youkai. You'd better be ready for them.)

Marisa:
Is that why you didn't come down here yourself and sent me instead? That's not fair.

Marisa:
So, the youkai underground are bad for me? It seems like the underground itself is pretty bad for me.

Patchouli:
(I read up on that youkai we ran across before.)
(It was an earth spider. A troublesome youkai who inflicts disease upon humans.)

Marisa:
Disease? Give me a break. So, can you tell what their weak points are, too?

???:
Are you a human?
Have humans come to explore the underground?

Marisa:
Oh, yes! That's exactly it.

Parsee:
Please, take my advice, you're better of just going right back where you came.

Marisa:
I don't feel like going back, though.
So, what can you tell me about this one? What's her power, or her weak point?

Patchouli:
(How should I know that already?)

Parsee:
Well, I tried to warn you... Humans truly are foolish.

Patchouli:
(Well, you're the one that provoked her, deal with her yourself.

Marisa:
Guess I have to. Well, please look up how to beat her while I beat her, okay?

Marisa:
Oh, looks I beat her.

Patchouli:
(... a Persian person driven by jealousy? I don't really understand.)

Marisa:
Why is a Persian underground?

Patchouli:
(Look, this is all conjecture. *scribbles notes*)

Marisa:
Hm. Why do I feel like I'm down here 
to conduct research on underground youkai?

???:
Hey, you're pretty good.
No idea who you are, but they say a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

???:
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so Keep following until you can't take anymore!

Marisa:
Oh?
I don't really want to follow you, but...

Marisa:
Man, what's with her?

Patchouli:
(I read up on that youkai we ran across before.)
(It was a bridge princess. A youkai driven mad by jealousy, sworn to protect the bridge.)

Marisa:
Hey, why not worry about this youkai that's here now instead? Read up on her, please!

???:
What, are you out of breath? Giving up already?

Patchouli:
(...... I can't conduct research that quickly!)

Marisa:
You're so useless.

???:
What's wrong? Are you trying to figure out who I am?

Marisa:
Hey! You got it, you're pretty good. That's it, now just tell me your weak point, please.

Yuugi:
I'm one of the Big Four of the Mountain, Yuugi the strong.
My weak point is fried beans, obviously.

Marisa:
Huh, I wish they'd all been this cooperative. Too bad I don't have any fried beans on me.

Patchouli:
(... Her weak point is fried beans?)
(Fried beans... No way.)

Yuugi:
So, why did you come all the way down here?

Marisa:
Huh, you know, I have no idea myself.

Patchouli:
(This place isn't our destination. Get rid of this pest so we can keep going.)

Marisa:
You're pretty violent.

Yuugi:
Yes, indeed.
I love violent people.

Yuugi:
But, if you're all talk, then you'll die here! I shall test your strength!

Yuugi:
Well done!
I expected nothing less from someone who made it all the way down here on their own.

Patchouli:
(...Well, let's move on. Let's just... leave her alone.)

Marisa:
... You know where we're supposed to go?
I have no idea where we even are.

Yuugi:
This place is Former Hell, a prison the youkai from above can't interfere with.
You beat me. I'll lead you wherever you want, if you wish.

Patchouli:
(... okay, then please take us to wherever the person who's creating the geyser is.)

Yuugi:
A geyser... Okay, why don't you try going to the Palace of the Earth Spirits up ahead?
It might be hard for a human... Well, it looks like you'll be strong enough.

Marisa:
Just strong enough to beat you, that's nothing to write home about.

Patchouli:
(Look at her, while she was fighting us and drinking, she didn't spill a drop of her sake.)
(And she hates fried beans. ...... you were just testing us, weren't you?)

Marisa:
What a weird mansion. The ground is so shiny, it's weird.

Patchouli:
(I wonder... if the person that made the geyser is here.)

Marisa:
Oh yeah, what about the geyser?

Patchouli:
(We have to stop it.)

Marisa:
Really? I don't really get it.
Besides, There's only cats and fairies in this mansion.

???:
... A visitor?
Are you human? No, you wouldn't be able to get this far.

Marisa:
Hm, there she is. Looks like a member of the household.

Patchouli:
(Uh, hurry up and ask her about the geyser.)

Marisa:
Um, excuse me? I want to ask you about the geyser...

???:
... geyser?
......
...... you really want to know about that?

Marisa:
Huh?

???:
It seems there's almost no information in your heart about the geyser.

Marisa:
What are you saying?

Patchouli:
(...)
(Wait a moment, I've got a bad feeling about this.)

Marisa:
...... Who are you?

Satori:
I'm Satori, the master of this household.

Patchouli:
(What!?)

Satori:
You seem human, what need do you have of me?

Marisa:
Well, you know, the geyser... What do I do now?

Patchouli:
(...... ask her how to stop the geyser.)

Marisa:
But I don't really want to stop it... Well, is there any way I can?

Satori:
How to stop the geyser, you say... I'm sure one of my pets would be able to do that.
Hm, 
"I want to meet her and have her make more hot springs"?

Marisa:
Eh? What?

Satori:
"How did she figure out what I was thinking", you say...

Patchouli:
(Marisa, she's more than you can handle. Hurry up and go find her pet.)

Satori:
I didn't give you permission to do that. Just how do you intend to go find her?

Marisa:
Huh? I'll just find her, somehow.

Satori:
"This sucks, maybe I should have asked her how I can beat this creep..."

Marisa:
Hey, how can you tell what I'm thinking?

Patchouli:
(Satori... I've heard of those before. They're said to be the most hated of the youkai underground.)
(A youkai that can read your heart. They can use their power to control the wordless spirits...)
(And only wordless animals love them. The animals grow up to become powerful youkai.)

Marisa:
......

Satori:
Well, what's the matter? Aren't you off to stop the geyser?

Marisa:
I don't feel comfortable with someone who can read my mind around.

Satori:
I can see it... My mind-reading third eye will show me your very heart!
The beautiful danmaku in your heart will make you suffer!

Satori:
Here's where it really begins!
Now, sleep with this trauma that will leave you sleepless!

Satori:
Hm, you're quite strong. It's good to attack humans.

Patchouli:
(...... Now, I'd like you to take us to that pet you mentioned before.)

Satori:
Very well. However...
I haven't seen this particular pet in quite some time, so I don't know what sort of youkai she's grown up to be.

Marisa:
What kind of master are you? It pisses me off how many irresponsible pet owners there are these days.

Satori:
My pets take care of themselves by absorbing various spirits and youkai.
Letting them run free is the best way to keep my stress down.

Patchouli:
(That cat we met before was probably running free... Just like our cat.)

Marisa:
Huh, you have a cat?

Patchouli:
(...... maybe that was a human we had. It's within the margin of error.)

Satori:
Well, I'll take you to the courtyard. There's a hole there that leads to the deepest parts of the underground.

Marisa:
Heading down again?

Marisa:
It sure is hot in this courtyard.

Patchouli:
(It's not supposed to be hot in the courtyard.)
(You're hot because you're wearing those heavy clothes.)

Marisa:
Yeah, I sure am. This is what I wear in winter, you know.

Marisa:
...... it's a cat. I wonder if cats love me now?

Patchouli:
(...... a black cat in the flames of hell. What a bad omen.)

???:
Tada~
Hey, sis, you're pretty good„Éº Your strength is growing on me!

Marisa:
What! The cat turned into a person!

Patchouli:
(A cat and a person... within the margin of error.)

Rin:
Oh yeah, sis, you wanted to find out about that geyser, right? I heard you talkin' about it before!
You'd better give up. You'd better give up. Ya hafta meet the worst bird ever to stop the geyser.
If she touches you, you'll melt right away, and looking in her eyes will drive you mad!
And now she's so dazzling you can't see a thing.

Marisa:
But, uh, Patchouli... What now?

Patchouli:
(You can only keep going, right? Right on past her.)
(If you can't stop the geyser, then something worse will happen.)

Marisa:
Guess I have no choice... But you're just watching from up there.
It's really hot down here.

Patchouli:
(I'm not just watching. I'm drinking tea while watching.)

Rin:
Hey, sis, you wanna keep going? Or you gonna turn back?

Marisa:
I don't wanna keep going!

Rin:
Aw, you don't wanna keep going? Great!
I'll be sure to be careful with your strong corpse and spirit when you're dead!

Rin:
Man, you're really strong. It's really touching!

Patchouli:
(Marisa, aren't you going any further?)
(You have to go steal lots of books from people's houses.)

Marisa:
Guess I gotta... Just this once!
So, what about the geyser? How can we stop her?

Rin:
You're going, right? You're going, right? I won't stop ya.
Man, I'm so happy.
There's no way she could do in a corpse as strong as you!

Marisa:
Hey, I'm still alive.

Patchouli:
(Ah, I've found it. She's a type of youkai called a kasha...)

Marisa:
I told you, I don't need to know about youkai after I've already beat them.

Rin:
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell ya something.

Marisa:
?

Rin:
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left. If I want your corpse,
I'd better take ya down here!

Marisa:
It keeps getting hotter the farther I go!

Patchouli:
(That's to be expected. If you climb a mountain, the temperature falls.)
(Contrarily, the further underground you go, the higher the temperature is. It's an easy enough conclusion to come to.)

Marisa:
But it was cold and snowy in that city before.

???:
I found you!
Orin told you about me. You want to stop the geyser, right?

Marisa:
Here she is! Don't stop the geyser!

Patchouli:
(Please stop the geyser.)

Utsuho:
What about the geyser, now? Why do I have to stop it?

Marisa:
Oh yeah, why does she have to stop it?

Patchouli:
(...... that geyser is a path for vengeful spirits to come above ground.)
(Vengeful spirits are gushing out of it even as we speak.)
(The spirits will possess any living thing, no, even non-living things and create ill will.)

Utsuho:
Vengeful spirits...? Vengeful spirits from the geyser?
What a weird story. I don't know anything about any vengeful spirits. They should be Orin's territory...

Patchouli:
(It doesn't matter, they're coming out! So, just stop the geyser.)

Marisa:
Hmmm. You should have told me that from the beginning.
I'll beat her and stop the geyser, and we'll feast on bird tonight!

Utsuho:
No. I don't know everything about what's going on, but...
I don't care about sending any spirits in. I wanted to go see above ground for myself...

Utsuho:
And then I'll melt it all away with my atomic fire.
Are you strong enough to fight in the preliminaries? Do you have a power that can match nuclear fusion!?

Marisa:
The wind's pretty strong for the inside of a cave.

???:
(...... heeey, can you hear me?)

Marisa:
... maybe I can, and maybe I can't.

Nitori:
(... I know you can hear me, it's me.)

Marisa:
I can't see you, "It's me." isn't enough for me to tell who you are.

???:
Oh? A human? How unusual.
Are you going to the festival they're having down below? You look like it.

Nitori:
(Here she is! It's a spider, an earth spider!)

Marisa:
Spider...¬†? Really?

Yamame:
Oh, looks like the cat's out of the bag.
Just when I thought I'd finally got myself some wild game.
You're no ordinary person, are you?

Nitori:
(Yah, an earth spider! We'll tear you to pieces!)

Yamame:
You're pretty interesting. I like you, let's play!

Nitori:
(Okay, good luck~)

Marisa:
Hey, now.

Marisa:
See? You provoked her, and I had to fight an unnecessary battle.

Nitori:
(But, they're always dirtying up our rivers...)

Marisa:
This is gonna be a long trip.

Marisa:
I wonder how far down this hole goes...

Nitori:
(Just a little farther until the Former Capital.)

Marisa:
Former Capital?

Nitori:
(It's where some old friends of ours live. It's a great underground city.)

Marisa:
What's that?

???:
Are you a human?
What does a human want in the Former Capital?

Marisa:
Oh, uh, well, Nothing in particular, I think.

Parsee:
Did you get lost? You'd better go back above ground if so.
Back to where the light is so dazzling...

Nitori:
(But everyone with really nasty powers is forced to live outside the city.)
(This is a youkai who controls jealousy. Beat her up good now, okay?)

Marisa:
Well, ah... It's not like I mind beating her, but...
It's kind of hard to have a conversation that way. Why am I even down here in the first place?

Nitori:
(Because of the hot springs, right? If you want to find hot springs, you've gotta go underground.)

Parsee:
You talk to yourself an awful lot.
Well, I'm sure nobody will mind terribly much if I just beat up one person...

Marisa:
I have no idea what's going on, but if there's gonna be hot springs, I don't care!

Nitori:
(Okay, we're almost to the Former Capital!)

Marisa:
What kind of youkai live in the Former Capital?

Nitori:
(Youkai that were sealed away out of revulsion, youkai that exiled themselves underground of their own accord...)
(There's some loud, anti-social types, and...)

Marisa:
Suddenly I don't think I want to go there anymore.

???:
Hey, you're pretty good.
No idea who you are, but they say a rowdy welcome is best for a rowdy guest!

???:
I like you!
We'll have lots more fun, so Keep following until you can't take anymore!

Nitori:
(I don't think she knows what troublesome company she's taking up...)

Marisa:
What's that? Is this one of those vile, hated youkai?

Nitori:
(......)

???:
What's wrong? Giving up already?

Nitori:
(Well, hello, I didn't think we'd stumble across someone like you...)

Marisa:
Huh? You know her?

Nitori:
(She's an oni, and they're boss of us kappa and the tengu.)

Yuugi:
What's that? I thought you were talking to yourself, but it's really those orbs, isn't it?

Nitori:
(The tengu and the kappa have only been in charge of the mountain since the oni have been gone.)
(Well, they've been gone for such a long time, and everything's been peaceful since, but...)

Marisa:
But isn't there an oni in Gensokyo already?

Nitori:
(Yeah, but we're no match for her even if she's alone. I don't want to think about if all the oni came back.)

Yuugi:
Indeed, I am one of the Big Four of the Mountain, Yuugi the strong.
However, I haven't been able to go the the mountains since I've come underground.

Nitori:
(Please, tell her to just stay there and not come back above ground.)

Marisa:
Hahaha, you didn't want to get caught by the boss, so you sent me down here instead?
Oh, man, this is hilarious. All I have to do is beat her, right?

Yuugi:
...... what are you going on about? It looks like those orbs know about me, though.

Marisa:
But enough of that, it's my turn now. So, why don't you let us pass?

Yuugi:
I wonder who's really behind those orbs... But first, if it's a fight you want, then it's a fight you'll get!

Yuugi:
Well done!
You're pretty mysterious, but you're really strong, so you can't be that bad.

Nitori:
(Alright, let's just get going now.)

Marisa:
Well, do you know where we're going? I don't have the slightest clue, you know.

Nitori:
(Well, if we want to find the hot springs, we've got to find whoever's making that geyser.)

Marisa:
Huh? So you're looking for the hot springs, too?
I guess I can see a kappa sitting in a hot springs and drinking sake.

Yuugi:
So, the voice in those orbs... Is a kappa's voice?
Heeey, can you hear me? You kappa in there!

Nitori:
(Bwuh!?)

Yuugi:
I bet it's peaceful and fun up in the mountain, right?

Nitori:
(Yes, yes, same as always.)

Yuugi:
Don't worry. I'm not going to try to take over the mountain again or anything.

Nitori:
(...... I hope you'll at least come up and go drinking with us sometime.)
(Even though we're all pretty busy...)

Marisa:
Hm, that person who's making the geyser... Will we meet them in this mansion?

Nitori:
(There should be more to the underground than just the Former Capital.)
(There has to be a way for us to go even deeper.)

Marisa:
You sure know a lot. Are you hiding something from me?

Nitori:
(You can tell the heat is coming from beneath this mansion.)
(It looks like there's a hole somewhere where we can go down.)

Marisa:
Hm, do you know something I don't? Oh well, if you're house hunting I dont mind helping.

???:
...... a visitor?
Are you a human? No, you wouldn't have been able to make it this far.

Marisa:
Oh, we've been found by a member of the household. Now I'm going to have to silence her!

Nitori:
(Good luck~ She looks kind of strong, though.)

Marisa:
Are you ready to sleep in the depths of hell?

???:
...... you're quite belligerent. How foolish.
...... a geyser? A hole that will lead you underground? Why are you looking for something like that?

Marisa:
Huh? Did I say something?

???:
You want a hot spring, don't you? So you're pretending to cooperate with the kappa.

Nitori:
(Hah?)

Marisa:
...... Who are you?

Satori:
I'm Satori, master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits.
I can tell everything you're thinking. My third eye shows me... Miss Marisa.

Marisa:
What? I still haven't said anything.

Nitori:
(Hey, just beat her up already.)

Marisa:
Huh, huuh? Well, okay. I guess I'll just have to beat her and search the house.

Satori:
"She can read my mind? That has to be some kind of trick."
"If that's true, she can tell what I'm about to think."
"Kappappa-, kappappa-, taking a big bite out of Kyuuchan cucumber-"

Marisa:
Wow, it's true! She can read my mind.
How can I beat someone like that?

Nitori:
(Just clear your mind and fight her.)

Marisa:
I- I guess.

Satori:
You know, even if you keep chanting "clear your mind, clear your mind"...
Well, it's been so long since I've seen a human we may as well fight a bit.
You have such beautiful danmaku in your heart.
With those beautiful danmaku, I'll chase you back up to your lukewarm above ground world!

Satori:
Here I come. From now on it's the real thing!
Sleep with the trauma that always wakes you up!

Satori:
You're quite strong, aren't you? It's nice to fight with humans.

Nitori:
(... oh, those were my danmaku. They were ever so slightly different, though.)

Marisa:
Pretty weird to fight the danmaku that just happen to come to mind...

Satori:
Now, what was it that you wanted? ...... oh, yes, the geyser.
I'll take you to the courtyard. There's a hole there that will lead you to the deepest part of the underground.

Marisa:
Okay. Oh yeah, Nitori, I still wanna know what you're up to.

Nitori:
(... oh, right. I'm interested in the youkai at the base of the geyser.)

Marisa:
The youkai at the base of the geyser?

Nitori:
(Well, it doesn't have anything to do with you. It's personal business!)

Marisa:
I just don't get what you're saying. I thought we were going to make off with equal shares.

Satori:
"But any treasure I find is all mine." I'd watch out, Miss Kappa inside the orbs.

Marisa:
Uhyo! Moving right along now...

Marisa:
Man, it's so hot! What is this place?

Nitori:
(This place...¬†? It looks like this is a real hell.)
(Ho ho ho, I can see it, I can see it„Éº)

Marisa:
Must be nice not to have to experience all this heat.

Marisa:
...... it's that cat again.
Hey, Nitori, maybe your orbs smell like fish? It's attracting this cat.

Nitori:
(Do they? *sniff sniff*)

???:
Tada~
They don't really smell like fish to me. All I can smell is human corpses!

Marisa:
Huh? The cat got big... wait.
Did you say the smell of corpses?

???:
Yep, the smell of strong human's corpses. Corpses that'll be worth carrying off!

Nitori:
(What's with her? She's kind of unsettling.)

Rin:
I heard you at Miss Satori's place.
You're looking for the youkai at the base of the geyser, right?
But, ya can't stop her. She's the worst bird there is.
You may be pretty strong, but she's really dangerous!

Nitori:
(The worst bird...¬†? That's it! We should go meet her, Marisa.)

Marisa:
Huh? Is someone telling you what to do?
I don't know what you're after, but I can smell treasure in it.

Nitori:
(Okay. If you can get your hands on my target, I'll share some of it with you.)

Marisa:
Well, that was easy. All right, it's settled, off we go!

Rin:
Hey, hey, hey, Sister Strong Corpse. Where ya goin'?

Marisa:
Sorry, I don't have to to play around with cats.

Rin:
Oh, it's so wonderful to see someone rushing to their death.
Your corpse and soul look pretty strong, Sis. I bet they'll make my cart pretty heavy.

Rin:
That's wonderful! You're so strong I was moved.

Nitori:
(Okay, let's go, let's go! The power I want is almost at hand!)

Marisa:
What kind of power is that?

Nitori:
(They say it's many times more powerful than electricity.)
(It'll revolutionize all our power production methods.)

Rin:
Are you talking about her power? Is that what you're after, Sis?
Hahahahaha, oh, this'll be fun. I guess I didn't have to try to stop you.
Just between you and me, her power is the power of the gods.
We animals of the deep get more powerful by eating ghosts and spirits, but..
Somehow she was able to swallow up a god.

Marisa:
I see. I don't really get it, but...
Maybe she can help me with my magical research, too.

Rin:
Oh right, I forgot to tell you one thing.

Marisa:
?

Rin:
If you die around here, you'll burn so hard there won't even be ashes left. If I want your corpse,
I'd better take you down here!

Marisa:
Man, the farther I go, the hotter it gets!
Is this heat power what you're after?

Nitori:
(They say that this power makes it hotter and high pressure.)
(They say it's the ultimate, final energy.)
(This heat is nowhere close.)

Marisa:
At this rate, I'm really going to burn up...

???:
I heard about you from Orin.
She told me a human came to see how magnificent my power was.

Nitori:
(She's heeeeere„Éº It's her, it's her!)

Marisa:
Well, I'm glad you're having fun. Are you drinking, or something?

Nitori:
(Well, I'm the first one to see this power the kappa heard of.)

???:
Ohoho, so they're even talking about me up above ground? I'm so happy.
But, how did you find out about me?

Nitori:
(The god of the mountain told us about you, and said it would advance our state of the art.)

???:
What? Why did the god of the mountain...¬†?

Marisa:
Sorry to cut in just as it's getting good, but just what is your power, anyway?
How will it make the kappa more advanced?

Utsuho:
I've gained the power of a certain god.
The Black Sun, Lord Yatagarasu. It's the same as the power of the sun.

Marisa:
What's the power of the sun? Photosynthesis? Sunburn?

Nitori:
(You're such an idiot. How can a magician be so ignorant?)
(It's solar energy. A super high temperature, high pressure world.)

Utsuho:
It's fusion energy.
Nuclear energy creates an almost everlasting, super high temperature power; this is Lord Yatagarasu's power.

Nitori:
(Because nuclear fusion requires such high temperatures, it's supposed to be hard to control, but...)
(This crow here can do it.)

Marisa:
That's amazing. The same power as the sun. I want it, too!

Nitori:
(Don't you?)
(So, Marisa, make sure you take her alive!)

Marisa:
Wait, are you serious!? She controls ultimate heat, you know?

Utsuho:
Each person who could would control fusion energy differently. What would you do with it if you could steal it away?
The ultimate vehicle? The ultimate weapon? Or, maybe, the ultimate magic?
Well, I want to revive the Blazing Hell. I'll melt the Earth away!

Sanae:
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

Reimu:
Hm, where is that idiot, anyway?

Yukari:
(Is it okay to call gods idiots? 
Well, I guess it is.)

Reimu:
If what that hell raven said is true, all the fighting I've been through is Kanako's doing.
Is she trying to take over the underground, too?

???:
Oh, what a perfect time to find a shrine maiden.
Do you know where the god of this shrine went?

Reimu:
Huh? I was just looking for them, too.

???:
Heh? The shrine's maiden is looking for its god? That's funny.
You must be hiding them, right?

Reimu:
Who are you?

Koishi:
I'm Koishi Komeiji, 
A humble shrine visitor.
I came all the way here from the underground, but I can't find this shrine's god...

Reimu:
Komeiji...? I think I've heard that name before.

Yukari:
(You heard it in the Palace of the Earth Spirits, remember?)

Koishi:
You know about the Palace!?

Reimu:
I went there a little bit ago.

Koishi:
Hey, are you...
The human my big sister was talking about?

Reimu:
I've got a bad feeling about this! Seriously.

Koishi:
My sister's pretty strong, but she got beaten by a vicious, empty-headed shrine maiden.

Reimu:
Hey, if you're Satori's sister, does that mean... you can...

Koishi:
Read your mind?
I've already closed my satori eye.
Reading people's minds only makes you depressed and there's nothing good about it.

Reimu:
Oh, thank goodness.
Well, I can't find Kanako or Suwako, so I think I'll be-

Koishi:
Hey, just a minute!
I couldn't find the gods of the mountain, but I found a good human.
I was looking for the strong person who gave Okuu the power of the gods.
But, if you beat Okuu, that must mean you're even stronger!
I definitely want to see the power of the person even my sister couldn't fight!

Koishi:
You sure aren't just any ordinary person.

Yukari:
(You really aren't, are you?)

Reimu:
I told you, I'm just trying to be a normal human.
Anyway, why are you looking for the gods?

Koishi:
Well, they were able to make sis's Okuu really strong even though she's just a hell raven, right?
Anybody would want to find them and become strong if they heard that, right?

Suwako:
Well, now, two visitors today? Excellent!

Reimu:
There you are. Where did the other god of the mountain go? I've been looking for her.

Suwako:
She's just out on a shopping trip.

Koishi:
Oh, are you one of the gods of the mountain? Can I ask you something?

Suwako:
Reimu, who's this?

Reimu:
She's Koishi, from Hell.

Suwako:
Huh. Koishi, a little rock? ... I thought she was a youkai. Well, what is it?

Koishi:
Mm. I was hoping I could get maybe a god for one of my pets.

Suwako:
...... what do you mean?

Reimu:
Oh yeah, now I remember. 
Were you up to something in the underground world?

Suwako:
Underground...? Are you talking about our Mountain Industrial Revolution project?

Reimu:
Industrial revolution project??

Suwako:
We've been inspecting the kappa's industrial facilities. 
They're pretty backwards compared to the outside world.
Kanako said that if they could find a new energy source, it would create a revolution.
Kanako loves technological revolutions.

Yukari:
(So, you sent the yatagarasu underground 
in order to obtain atomic energy?)

Suwako:
I told her "wouldn't nuclear power be dangerous for the kappa?", but still....
So? How did it go?

Reimu:
Hey, you guys...
Next time, tell everyone about it before you start!
I had to go all the way to the Hell of Blazing Fires because of you!

Yukari:
(Hmm... good work, Reimu. 
You really did well.)
(I see how all of this happened now. 
You can go home and rest, in the hot springs or whatever.)

Koishi:
Are you done talking?
I want to find a god with the gloomy power of love for my pets...

Reimu:
You think anyone would give you that kind of power?

Sanae:
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

Reimu:
Where is that idiot, I wonder?
If what that hell raven said is true, all the fighting I've been through is Kanako's work.

Suika:
(Heeey! Where are we off playing today?)

Reimu:
Why is an oni talking to me through my orbs when I'm still above ground?

???:
Oh, what a good time to find a shrine maiden.
Do you know where the god of this shrine went?

Reimu:
Wah? I'm looking for her, too.

???:
Heh? The shrine's maiden is looking for its god? That's funny.
She must be hiding, right?

Suika:
(Huh? That voice, that person...)
(You're Koishi from the Komeiji place, right? What're you doing on top of a mountain like this?)

Koishi:
Hmm? Have we met before?

Reimu:
Huh? You know her?

Suika:
(Hey, remember the scary lady in the Palace of the Earth Spirits? This is her little sister.)

Reimu:
Eh? Satori's sister?

Koishi:
Hmmm, are you the human who beat my sister and Okuu?

Reimu:
Something like that, yes.

Koishi:
I wasn't able to find the god of the mountain, but I can't believe I met someone like you up here.
What a long trip it must have been!
Or maybe you're this shrine's shrine maiden?

Reimu:
No, no, there's no way I'd live in a place way out in the sticks like this.

Koishi:
Really? Well, it doesn't matter.
If you beat my sister, I'd better test your power for myself.

Reimu:
Man, everyone's the same wherever I go. Why do I have to keep fighting these people?

Suika:
(Reimu, Koishi has a power that compensates for her sister's weak point.)

Reimu:
Satori's weak point?

Suika:
(Satori's mind reading is her weak point. Koishi decided to close her third eye by herself.)

Koishi:
What are you talking to yourself about?
I can't read minds like my sister. Please talk to me with words I can hear.

Reimu:
Her mind reading was a weakness, so she closed her third eye?
Well, then, she's just a regular youkai! This'll be an easy win.

Koishi:
I don't really understand, but are you ready?
Let me tell you something good. My sister could never win against me.
Why? I can act against the subconscious that she can't read.
The danmaku that lurk in your subconscious are danmaku that my sister has never seen!

Koishi:
Oh, wow! You're not just any normal person, are you?

Reimu:
That didn't hurt, but it sure does itch!

Koishi:
I can see how my sister, Okuu, and Orin wouldn't stand a chance against you.
My bullets can never hit you.

Suika:
(zzzz... zzzz... oh, hey, it's over?)

Reimu:
Yeah, it ended while you were passed out from drinking too much.

Koishi:
Anyway, why are you so strong?

Reimu:
Well, so I can take care of troublesome youkai like you, of course.

Koishi:
That's boring! I'd use it to do something a lot more fun.

Reimu:
Well, youkai extermination can be pretty boring.

Koishi:
I'd start a love-stricken massacre! Or maybe pillage from a bunch of peaceful humans.

Suika:
(Well, she's a youkai, after all. Why don't we play together next time you're above ground?)

Koishi:
Wow, you're really nice! It sure is fun up here.

Reimu:
Hey, now! Don't make any weird promises for me!
And make sure I'm not around when you do that.

Suika:
(By the way, Reimu?)

Reimu:
What?

Suika:
(Why did you come all the way out to this shrine?)

Reimu:
Oh, right. There's something I wanted to ask Kanako and Suwako.

Sanae:
They're both out right now.
I'm watching the shrine while they're gone.

Reimu:
Mm, so they're gone...

Sanae:
What did you want to ask them? I can pass the message along.

Reimu:
It was about the crow from underground... er, do you know what I'm talking about?

Sanae:
Of course I do. The hell crow with the yatagarasu, right?

Reimu:
Eh? How do you know about that?

Sanae:
Lady Kanako said it was her secret plan to revolutionize industry on the mountain.
She said if we could obtain clean energy, it would bring more believers to the shrine.

Reimu:
What?

Sanae:
The feeding of the crow was successful. I guess you could say the first stage is complete.
She was a lot calmer than I imagined, and listened to what we had to say.
I thought she'd go wild above ground; this is kind of anticlimactic.

Reimu:
You mean my whole ordeal underground...
Was just to help out with your kappa industrial revolution?

Sanae:
Oh? You went underground? Why?

Reimu:
Oh, whatever. I'm seriously tired, so I'm going back to have a bath and go to bed!

Sanae:
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

Reimu:
Hm, where did that idiot go?
If what Aya said is true, all this fighting I had to go through was Kanako's fault.

Aya:
(sniff sniff)

Reimu:
Uh, if you want to write an article, go ahead and do it.

Aya:
(I am! It's focused on why the gods of the mountain interfered with the underground.)

Reimu:
That's right, good luck.

???:
Oh, what a good time to find a shrine maiden.
Do you know where the god of this shrine went?

Reimu:
Wah? I'm looking for her, too.

???:
Heh? The shrine's maiden is looking for its god? That's funny.
She must be hiding, right?

Aya:
(Who is she? ... I can't imagine the tengu would let a youkai like her onto the mountain.)

???:
Hmmm? Wasn't there anyone in the shrine?

Aya:
(I can't feel a thing coming from her, either. Who on earth...)

Koishi:
I'm Koishi Komeiji. I came all the way from the underground world to visit.

Reimu:
The underground?
I think maybe it's too easy to go back and forth between the two now...

Aya:
(In any case, it's not good for people to be able to just come onto the mountain anytime they please.)
(Let's chase her away.)

Reimu:
Why do I have to do it for you?
We're not underground anymore, so you can do it yourself.

Aya:
(Ah, well, it looks like I've gotten used to this sort of remote operation...)

Koishi:
Well, is the god here or not?

Reimu:
I don't know.

Koishi:
Oh, what a pain. I don't want to go home without a souvenir after coming all this way.
Will you play with me?

Reimu:
Huh?

Koishi:
I thought it would be nice to kill some time... won't you?

Aya:
(Just what we wanted! Now, let's fight her the usual way!)

Koishi:
Oh, perfect! I like people with authority.
I guess there are strong people up here, too... My sister was talking about that recently.

Reimu:
Your sister?

Koishi:
She said she was beaten by someone dressed in auspicious colors.
But, what kind of colors are those?

Reimu:
Hmm, I'm not really sure, but maybe something like white and red... perhaps.

Koishi:
Ohoho, then that's perfect.

Koishi:
You're the human that came down to the underground, aren't you?
My sister was talking about you... she said your power would be pretty useful.

Reimu:
Who's your sister?

Koishi:
If I can take you alive, you'll be a great pet who can do the cleaning work of tons of spirits!

Koishi:
Wow, you're really strong! No way I can take you alive.
Are you really human?

Reimu:
Of course I'm human.

Aya:
(Hey, just a minute, you!)

Koishi:
Me?

Aya:
(That was amazing. Your power is really amazing.)
(I think I'd like to interview you some time, if I may.)

Koishi:
Interview me?

Aya:
(I'd like to come visit you in your house. Would you mind?)

Suwako:
Oho? What happened while I was out?

Reimu:
Ah, I finally found you! I've been looking for you, you know.

Suwako:
You need something from me? Well, that's unusual.

Koishi:
Interview me at my house? If you can come all the way to the Palace of the Earth Spirits in the Former Capital, you're more than welcome too.

Aya:
(The Former Capital... hmmm, I don't know if I can go there...)

Suwako:
Palace of the Earth Spirits? Reimu, who is this girl?

Reimu:
I don't know. She's some person from the underground.

Suwako:
Oh, that's right, we were visiting around the Palace of the Earth Spirits the other day, Kanako and I.

Reimu:
You were?

Suwako:
We were looking for a high temperature, high pressure furnace to revolutionize the kappa's energy production.
We heard that the Remains of Blazing Hell wasn't being used anymore, so we went to go look.
We heard it was right under a building called the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

Koishi:
Hm? Are you the mountain god that came to my house and gave Okuu that power?

Suwako:
Well, to be specific, it was Kanako. Are you from the Palace of the Earth Spirits?
Sorry for borrowing that hell raven without your permission.
But, it looks like she's helped us create our Nuclear Furnace.

Koishi:
Oh, it's okay, it's great that Okuu got really strong. Please do it as much as you like.

Reimu:
What are you talking about?
I don't really understand what's going on, but are you planning something underground?

Aya:
(Come to think of it, the kappa have been really excited lately... maybe it's related.)

Koishi:
Wow, mountain gods, auspicious humans, the above ground world is just full of strong people.
You're welcome to come to the Palace of the Earth Spirits any time you want. We'll welcome you whenever you come.

Reimu:
The Palace of the Earth Spirits? No thanks, that's where Satori lives.

Koishi:
Oh, you don't like my sister?

Reimu:
Well, she can read minds, you know? Wait, your sister!?

Sanae:
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

Marisa:
Woah, it's cold up on the mountain.
The hot springs appeared and the spirits went away, isn't that enough work for now?

Alice:
(Look, it's the extra dungeon for after you beat the game. Good luck!)

Marisa:
Geez, who started that, anyway?
Isn't it enough to have cleared the game in the first place?
If there's always an extra dungeon, then the last boss just becomes a midboss!

Alice:
(Don't be so blunt. Look, according to the hell raven,)
(She got the power of nuclear fusion from the gods of the mountain, right?)

Marisa:
Yeah, that's right. I came here to get some sort of divine blessing, too.

???:
Um, excuse me ...
Have you seen anyone from this shrine?

Marisa:
Yeah, I just beat her over there.

???:
You beat her?

Marisa:
She came at me from over there, so it was in self-defense.

???:
Oh my, it looks like no-one's here. What a shame.

Marisa:
What's wrong? Coming to pray for good grades?
I'll introduce you at the shrine below the mountain. There's a shrine maiden there that never has anything to do.

???:
I'd rather visit the shrine on the mountain. I came here to get a divine blessing from the gods in this shrine.

Alice:
(What's the divine blessing of the Moriya Shrine, anyway?)

Marisa:
I don't know, something good, like the nuclear fusion power she gave that crow, right?

???:
Nuclear fusion, crow? Are you talking about Okuu?

Marisa:
Who's Okuu?

Alice:
(She's talking about that hell raven, Utsuho.)

Marisa:
Oh, it's 'cos her name is written with the kuu character for "empty". That poor girl who got demoted to midboss.

???:
You two know about Okuu? Who are you?

Marisa:
I'm the great magician, Marisa Kirisame. Don't forget it.
Anyway, who are you? Any pilgrim to this shrine is pretty suspicious, if you ask me.

Koishi:
Okuu is one of my sister's pets.
I was so jealous of her power-up.
I thought if I came here, my pets could become more powerful, too.

Alice:
(Are you Miss Satori's younger sister!?)

Marisa:
What's that? Did Satori have a little sister like her?

Koishi:
Oh? You even know about my big sister?
Are you two ...

Marisa:
Like I said, I'm Marisa, the Great Sage.

Koishi:
Are you the doll-using thief that they said visited our house?

Marisa:
Wha-

Alice:
(Tee hee.)

Koishi:
I'm Koishi Komeiji.
I couldn't find the gods of the mountain, but it looks like I found a good playmate.
Stealing is bad, okay? Miss Above Ground Human.

Marisa:
Well, whatever. I did beat Kanako and Suwako, though.
It looks like they're not around, so I'll play with you.

Koishi:
I heard about you from my sister and Okuu.
That thief dodged danmaku just like bits of paper dancing in the air.
She said you were psychologically unsettling, like a flea crawling up your back.
If I beat you and take you back home, I'll definitely become the talk of the house!

Koishi:
You're stroooong! I can see how you beat my sister.

Marisa:
Yep, I crushed you easily!

Alice:
(Was it really that easy?)

Koishi:
Thanks for spending time with me!
I couldn't take you alive, but this will probably be worth some talk back home.

Marisa:
Uh, oh yeah, you're Satori's little sister ...
So, uh, can you read minds, too?

Koishi:
Nope, I closed my third eye.

Marisa:
Third eye?

Koishi:
The third eye, which can see through people's minds. But that's what makes my sister weak.
I realized that mind reading made me lose to people's subconscious.
So I don't read people's minds anymore. Uh, no, I guess I can't, really.

Marisa:
I don't get it, but thank goodness.

Alice:
(What a shame. You could control people easily with that kind of power.)

Koishi:
It's not that great. The conscious always loses to the unconscious.
People don't just act on what they consciously think.
They act on both the conscious and the unconscious. If you read their mind, you can't tell what's going on in their subconscious mind.

Marisa:
Hmm, I see. Well, I got all warmed up, but I couldn't find Kanako or anyone else.
Guess I'd better be heading home.

Alice:
(What? Don't tell me you're done here?)

Marisa:
Well, Reimu will take care of seeing if there's anything between the underground and the mountain gods.
I'll just ask her later.

Alice:
(You're so easygoing. Maybe I should look into it myself, later?)

Marisa:
Besides, I figured out something really important.

Alice:
(...¬†? What?)

Marisa:
The shrine's totally empty now. It's the perfect time to go fishing.

Koishi:
Oh my, thieving is bad, you know?

‚Äî‚Äî:
"Later, Kanako caught Marisa going through their house."
"She got put through the wringer. The End."

Sanae:
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

Marisa:
It sure is cold on the mountain. I guess it's winter, after all.

Patchouli:
(Ah, it's so wonderful to spend the afternoon 
sipping warm tea in a warm house.)

Marisa:
Hey, you looking for a fight?
Why do you have to do this while I'm above ground, anyway?

Patchouli:
(Mountains in winter are dangerous for novices. It's best not to recklessly decide to climb them.)

Marisa:
The Remains of Blazing Hell was way more dangerous than this.

Patchouli:
(In any case, if what that hell raven said was true,)
(Then she got the power to control nuclear fusion from the gods of this mountain.)

???:
Um, excuse me...?
Have you seen anyone from this shrine?

Marisa:
Well, uh...?

Patchouli:
(I don't know, I was reading a book.)

Marisa:
Huh, I guess not, then. Sorry, but I don't know too much about this shrine.

???:
Oh, I see, sorry to have bothered you. Maybe they're out now...

Marisa:
Did you try visiting the main building?

???:
Yes. It was just an empty shell.

Marisa:
What do I do now, Patchouli?

Patchouli:
(Hmm, there's nothing you can do if they're not here.)

???:
Are you looking for the gods of the mountain, too?

Marisa:
Yeah, kind of.

???:
Did you come to this shrine looking for power, too?

Marisa:
Power?

???:
I heard you can get the ultimate power if you meet the gods of the mountain.

Patchouli:
(Really, now? Who's been spreading that rumor?)

Koishi:
I heard it from one of my sister's pets. The gods of the mountain made Okuu really strong.

Marisa:
Okuu? Sister? I've got a bad feeling about this.

Patchouli:
(... a bad feeling... Marisa.)
(I'm going to take a bit of an afternoon nap. Good luck!)

Marisa:
Hey, hey!

Koishi:
Do you want the mountain gods' power, too?

Marisa:
Well, that's not what I came for, but I wouldn't mind it.

Koishi:
Then that makes us rivals.
My sister is always saying that you can't make your dreams come true if you can't beat all your rivals.
I don't have anything against you, but I hope you're ready to die a dog's death.
Oh, don't worry, that cat will carry off your body, so you'll be able to live in our place!

Koishi:
Wooow... you're really strong„Éº I see I was wrong to think you're just some normal human.

Marisa:
But I am human.

Koishi:
No way! I can't believe a human could be so strong... oh,
Are you the person that came to play in the Palace of the Earth Spirits?

Marisa:
Palace of the Earth Spirits? Hm, I think I've been there before.

Koishi:
Really? There can't be that many people as strong as you.
I'm Koishi Komeiji. I live in the Palace of the Earth Spirits.

Patchouli:
(What did she say...? I thought she was just a normal human shrine visitor at first.)

Marisa:
Huh, your intuition's not that great. It's obvious she's a youkai to me.

Patchouli:
(... you don't feel like a youkai to me.)
(Actually... I can't sense anything at all from you.)

Koishi:
That's because I deal with the subconscious.
Since I closed off my ability to read minds, I gained the ability to move around free of thought.

Patchouli:
(A state of mu... If a Buddhist priest heard of her, he'd cry tears of joy.)

Marisa:
But, I won, anyhow.

Koishi:
You're really strong. Do you want to come play at my house?

Marisa:
Well, I don't have anything better to do, but it's so far away.

Patchouli:
(Are you Satori's younger sister?)

Koishi:
Yes!

Patchouli:
(Hmm, I hadn't heard that she had a younger sister.)

Sanae:
Hm, they're still not back?

Marisa:
Oh, it's Sanae. What were you off doing?

Sanae:
We just saw each other a few minutes ago!
Anyway, what are you here for? Lady Kanako and Lady Suwako are both out.

Marisa:
Hmmm, let's see...
Hey, Patchouli, we wanted to ask the gods something, right?

Patchouli:
(Satori's little sister... um, let's see, don't I have any documents on her somewhere?)
(Huh? Something to ask the gods? Yes, about nuclear fusion, remember?)

Sanae:
Nuclear fusion...? Yes, our plan is going along quite nicely.

Marisa:
Huh?

Sanae:
Oh, didn't you hear? We're going to create a kappa industrial revolution by using the old Remains of Blazing Hell.
If it works, our standard of living will be much better.
Nuclear fusion energy is a clean energy that even the outside world hasn't mastered yet.
It's exciting to think that I'll see the power of the sun harnessed here on the Earth.

Marisa:
I don't understand what you're saying at all.

Patchouli:
(So, nuclear fusion is the key to revolutionizing the kappa's industry?)

Marisa:
Anyway, it's not dangerous, right?

Sanae:
Of course not. I guess Lady Kanako didn't explain this to you, did she?
It might cause geysers, which might make hot springs appear, though.

Patchouli:
(So, in the end, this whole incident was just a misunderstanding caused by the gods of the mountain not explaining things?)
(I'm tired... I'm going to bed.)

Koishi:
Well, I'm going home, but come play with me some time„Éº You promised„Éº

Marisa:
Well, this is nice. Now I have an excuse to go see the underground as much as I want.
Okay, let's do it!

Sanae:
Oh, did you come to visit the shrine in this cold weather?
Hehe, I've learned how to do the greetings here.
You can't let yourself be held back by common sense in Gensokyo, right!?

Marisa:
It sure is cold on the mountain. I guess it's winter, after all.

Nitori:
(The rivers freeze over in the winter. It makes life easy for us.)

Marisa:
The rivers freezing makes it easy on you? Why's that?

Nitori:
(It's actually warm underneath the ice.)

Marisa:
Anyhow can I interrupt?
Why are you talking to me like this when I'm on the mountain?

Nitori:
(I guess it's become a habit. Besides, I don't wanna leave the water.)

Marisa:
Oh well, whatever.

Nitori:
(If you want a share of our nuclear energy, stop complaining.)
(We tamed the crow in charge of it, so now we just have to go tell the god of the mountain.)

???:
Um, excuse me?
Have you seen anyone from this shrine?

Marisa:
Nope.

Nitori:
(You liar, we just saw someone.)

Marisa:
Oh, yeah, just a minute ago. We beat her, though.

???:
You beat her? Why?

Marisa:
It was her way of greeting us, or something like that.

Nitori:
(Hmm. It looks like the gods aren't here today. Let's come back later.)

???:
What? The gods aren't here?
Oh, no. And I came all the way up here from deep underground...

Marisa:
What? Did you say from deep underground?

???:
What a waste of time to come while the gods are out... What could I possibly gain from this?

Marisa:
Ah, you gained tiredness.

???:
Huh? I'm not tired yet.

Nitori:
(Marisa, she might want to get her hands on fusion energy, too.)
(Be careful.)

???:
Fusion energy? How do you know about fusion energy?
But man, those mountain gods have a pretty nice shrine, don't they?

Marisa:
You... are you after fusion energy, too!?

Nitori:
(We're not gonna hand it over! Take her down, Marisa!)

Marisa:
Hey, calm down. Maybe she's just a normal shrine visitor.

???:
Hmm, you're the human that came to the underground, aren't you?

Koishi:
Sis mentioned a weird human with orbs that disturbed our home.

Marisa:
Your sister?

Koishi:
If you wanted to beat me like you did Sis and Okuu, by all means.
Since I went to the trouble of coming up from the underground, I'd like to get something out of it.

Nitori:
(Hey, Marisa What are you doing? Hurry up and get her out of here)

Marisa:
Y...yeah
I won't hand over the power of fusion to you. Get out of here.

Koishi:
Hm, if you want to turn me away, just try to beat me.
Don't get confident just because you beat my sister, though.
We'll decorate the entrance of the Palace of the Earth Spirits with your corpse!

Marisa:
Who's your sister, anyway?

Koishi:
Wow, you're really strong! I can see how my sister lost to you.

Marisa:
Hey, is your sister...?

Koishi:
Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you the one who visited the Palace?

Marisa:
I knew it, you're that Satori girl's sister...

Koishi:
Yeah, I thought this would be a waste since the gods aren't in,
but it looks like I found something worthwhile after all.

Nitori:
(So what did you come here for?)

Koishi:
Well, I heard that the god who gave Okuu nuclear fusion power lived on a mountain.
I was wondering if I could get some powers for my pets, too.

Nitori:
(That's too bad. These gods probably won't do anything that won't benefit them.)
(The only reason your house's pet got nuclear fusion power is because it helped their plans.)

Koishi:
What, really? That's boring...
Oh well, I got to meet someone interesting.

Marisa:
I'm pretty interesting.

Koishi:
Come play at my house next time. We'll find some interesting spirits for you, or something.

Marisa:
Hmm. I don't mind going...
But it could be pretty hard getting there.

Koishi:
Oh, don't worry. If you just tell people you're friends with the people at the Palace,
I'm sure most of the youkai will avoid you.

Nitori:
(... wow, everybody hates them.)

Koishi:
My sister is bad at fighting, but everybody is afraid of her.
Just say her name, and you'll have free run of the underground.

Marisa:
Hm, so does that mean I can go anywhere I want down there?

Nitori:
(Well, I, uh...)

Marisa:
Oh, yeah.
There's someone else who doesn't like you too much.

Koishi:
Who's that?

Nitori:
(Whatever, I'll be fine. If you want to go back underground, you can go by yourself.)

Koishi:
By yourself, what? Aren't you... Do you have multiple personalities?

Marisa:
Nope, from now on I'm just the one personality.

Reimu:
That flying thing is so fast! I'm not going to catch up to it if I'm half-hearted about it!

???:
Gensokyo is so cramped and small.

Nazrin:
Where are you going in such a hurry?

Reimu:
Out of my way! Hm, you were here before, too, little grey youkai. I don't have the time to deal with small animals that die easily like you!

Nazrin:
Really? Too bad.

Reimu:
Even as we speak, that treasure ship is getting away, far away...

Nazrin:
Treasure ship? You mean that thing floating in the sky? Ohoho, are you stupid? Did you really think that's a treasure ship?

Reimu:
Fine, whatever, I'm stupid, now get out of my way!

Nazrin:
If you're looking for treasure, don't look in the sky. There's lots packed away in kitchen nooks and crannies.

Reimu:
Aw, she disappeared into the clouds. I guess I'll have to go further into the clouds. But I bet there's tons of youkai up there, ugh ...

???:
Hang on just a minute ...

Reimu:
What? You're just a plain old youkai.

???:
You don't have to be so mean! I've had lots of free time lately~

Reimu:
I'm chasing that ship right in front of us. I don't have time to waste on small fry like you.

Kogasa:
Oh, you can play with me while you're chasing that ship, can't you?

Reimu:
Hmph. It must be nice to be a youkai with spare time. Even if you only exist to be exterminated. Still, there are too many to take care of them all, so I'll leave you for next time.

Kogasa:
This is why humans aren't any fun. Why can't you just make time for me? Shouldn't you plan extra time into your schedule? You can go find that treasure ship any time.

Reimu:
Extra time is pointless for me right now. I don't want to waste a single second.

Kogasa:
But the pointlessness is what's really beautiful. It would be terrible if everything in life were all planned out. 
Even tools aren't beautiful just because they're functional. The useless parts are what make us youkai ...

Reimu:
Why am I getting lectured by a cursed umbrella!? Fine, I'll beat you while I chase it, okay?

Reimu:
Just fall out of the sky, you stupid umbrella youkai.

Kogasa:
Oh, humans are so cruel.

Reimu:
Hey, you looked like you wanted me to beat you. Hmm, what do they call that?

Kogasa:
I dunno, sadism?

Reimu:
I think that's opposite, but whatever. I can see the ship now, so thanks for taking me to it.

???:
Humans, fairies, and all, everyone seems to be after this ship ... are they after the treasure room?

Reimu:
Treasure room? ... so, this ship really is a ...

???:
Well, no point in arguing! I'll show no mercy to any enemy!

???:
Oh! To think that there are still humans that wouldn't run away after seeing this fist ...

Reimu:
This ship really is a treasure ship, right? It doesn't look like there's anything in it, but ...

Reimu:
Hey, she ran away.

???:
Just what are you after? Treasure? Or perhaps my sister's power?

Reimu:
Treasure, of course!

???:
Hmmm. So you're just a common ruffian.

Reimu:
This ship looks pretty bleak, though.

Ichirin:
I regret to have to tell you there's no treasure left.

Reimu:
What was that?

Ichirin:
The treasure with the power to fly also brings about change in humans ... Most of it has been lost whilst my sister slept. It's fallen down into the world.

Reimu:
Huuh? But what about all the riches?

Ichirin:
Riches? Is that what you're after? There never were any. None with any real monetary worth, anyway.

Reimu:
This really sucks.

Ichirin:
... hm? You mean, this shrine maiden has ...¬†? Unzan tells me you're after the fragments of the flying treasure. Is this true?

Reimu:
No, I'm not.

Ichirin:
Unzan would have no reason to lie. Excellent! You don't have to hide it. You're collecting those fragments flying through the sky, right? You must be trying to revive my sister as well! How splendid.

Reimu:
What the heck are you talking about? I just thought there were riches on this treasure ship!

Ichirin:
It's okay. Now, hand over the treasure you've found!

Ichirin:
You're quite strong. Unzan says you must be a very famous person.

Reimu:
R-really? Well, that may be.

Ichirin:
The floating fragments you've collected are necessary for my sister's revival. Now, please bring them inside.

Reimu:
There's no treasure, right? What a letdown. Well, I guess I have to go see what this ship really is. It doesn't look like I'll get anything for it, though.

Reimu:
Yeah. Okay, there's nothing inside the ship. 
It'll be good to be done with this investigation. It's so boring. 
I mean, all that's happening is the ship's just flying around. 
If it's not a treasure ship, there's no point to it. It's just a box.

???:
Is someone there? A human ... ...¬†? Or have you also given up your humanity?

Reimu:
Hmph, It looks like I missed something. There's a youkai! I'll have to beat you!

???:
I see, you're human, right? 
Then you'd better just put down those treasures and leave this ship immediately. 
We'll be reaching our destination soon. There won't be any going back then.

Reimu:
Destination? Who are you, anyway ...¬†?

Minamitsu:
Oh, where are my manners? I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.

Reimu:
Captain?

Minamitsu:
This ship will be leaving this land to go to another world, where Hijiri is sealed away. There, we'll revive Hijiri, and everyone will be able to forget their troubles. 
We'll make a paradise where no-one can brush us aside ... We'll make a liberating future where we can use our powers freely ... 
That paradise is this ship's destination. That's the ideal Hijiri has sought. 
So, anyone with any lingering connection to this world should disembark; what will you do?

Reimu:
I don't understand what you're saying, but ... 
I understand this isn't a treasure ship now. 
It's a devils' nest where youkai hide out, isn't it? I can't overlook this.

Minamitsu:
If you can't overlook it ...¬†?

Reimu:
Then I'll just have to beat the captain and drop this ship out of the sky.

Minamitsu:
I forgot to mention this, but we absolutely need that treasure in order to go to the other world. 
The mysterious flying objects that you have are fragments of that treasure.

Reimu:
You mean you're trying to get all these?

Minamitsu:
So, I was hoping you'd co-operate with us, but ... Too bad. 
It looks like letting you on puts us in danger of sinking. Fall out of this ship and bathe in the cursed oceans!

Minamitsu:
This power's buried a lot of youkai, hasn't it?

Reimu:
That's right! So stop doing bad things!

Minamitsu:
But we're not doing anything bad.

Reimu:
Of course you are, you're a youkai, right?

Minamitsu:
I can't just stop being a youkai~

Reimu:
Hm, this ship really isn't stopping, is it? Even though the captain isn't doing anything ...

Minamitsu:
It's in auto-mode.

Reimu:
Now that I know this isn't a treasure ship, I'm not that interested. 
Now I finally know what this ship really is. 
But I still have to find out where it's going!

Nazrin:
Hmm? So you came to Makai, too?

Reimu:
Hmm, have we met somewhere before? Wait, did you say Makai? 
That stupid captain, does that mean you were sailing to Makai?

Nazrin:
I see they must have brought you here to Makai with your treasure sometime. 
Captain Murasa's done a good job. 
Meanwhile, I've also found the other treasure that I've been looking for. 
Maybe I'll test the power of this Bishamonten pagoda on you before I hand it over to my master.

Reimu:
So this is Makai? 
That explains why I feel so horrible being here. 
So they came all the way down here to break a seal or something? That can't be good.

???:
I've been waiting for you! 
You're the human who gathered the flying treasure, yes? You look a lot more scrawny than I imagined.

Reimu:
How rude.

???:
I'm sorry, you're quite right. 
I simply thought that if you'd made it this far, maybe you were some sort of ascetic scholar.

Reimu:
Well, I do mean to learn a lot while I'm here.

Shou:
I am the representative of Bishamonten, a devotee of Hijiri's creed. 
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought, as well as the fragments of the Flying Storage you possess, 
We can break the seal here. We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

Reimu:
The treasure I brought? Do you mean those UFO toys?

Shou:
UFO? Ah, I suppose you might look at it that way. 
Now, together, let us bring light into Hokkai and-

Reimu:
Who cares! I only came this far chasing a treasure ship.

Shou:
A treasure ... ship?

Reimu:
When I took a look inside, the ship was empty. 
I thought there'd be something onboard, and suddenly I was in Makai. 
I'm sick of all this!

Shou:
There's nothing to be disappointed about. 
You could call the holy palanquin a treasure ship.

Reimu:
Huh?

Shou:
Well, the seven gods of luck ride a treasure ship, right? 
And one of them, Bishamonten, is right here. Isn't that fortunate?

Reimu:
Whatever. 
Look, I'll just beat you and then beat that sealed whoever and then go home!

Shou:
Very well. If you want to fight me, I'll be your opponent. 
However, if you've chosen to follow the wrong path ... 
Then you'll have to bear witness to the light of dharma which is even brighter here in Makai -- 
And bow down before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

Shou:
How splendid. I can see how you could have gathered the treasure.

Reimu:
I could beat someone like you before breakfast.

Shou:
Well, now that you've beaten me, what will you do next?

Reimu:
Look! You need this UFO toy, right? To break the seal. 
Let's go see just what's been sealed away.

Shou:
Yes, you're new to the group, but let's prepare to break the seal.

Reimu:
Hmph! I'll beat whoever's sealed away, and then this'll all be taken care of.

Shou:
Please don't make fun of Hijiri, the seal is open now.

Reimu:
Okay, come on out! 
I know you've been sealed in here somewhere, okay? 
I can't hear anyone ... ... 
What a mysterious place. I can't sense anyone at all.

???:
O, the world of dharma is filled with light. Are you the one who liberated this world?

Reimu:
I finally found you. You're those youkai's boss, right?

???:
Youkai? Boss?

Reimu:
Right, those youkai were trying to bring you back.

???:
Really ... 
Even though I haven't been able to do anything for them for over a thousand years ... 
So, there are still youkai who miss me ...

Reimu:
Well, who are you, anyway?

Byakuren:
My name is Byakuren. 
I used to be a monk a long, long time ago. 
You seem to be a shrine maiden, am I right? 
Did you come down here to seal me away again?

Reimu:
Oh, yes, that's exactly right!

Byakuren:
You're another oppressor of youkai, aren't you? 
You know, I realized that gods and buddhas are no more than youkai. 
But youkai are hated, and gods are worshipped. That's because humans decided it should be that way.

Reimu:
Huh? Well, I've beaten gods, too ...

Byakuren:
Yes, my scrolls are full of the light of Buddha. 
From now on, I'll have to make sure I show my gratitude to those who freed me.

Reimu:
Hmm, I wonder if it'd really be okay to leave you alone?

Byakuren:
I can't change your desire to eliminate all youkai. 
However, if you're going to seal me away again --

Byakuren:
I will resist you with all my strength.

Reimu:
Yes, there we go! 
I'll beat anyone who's a friend to youkai!

Byakuren:
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple. How foolish and self-centered you are! Now, namusan ‚Äï‚Äï¬†!

Reimu:
That ship ... ... flew away without a sound. How suspicious. 
And there were those fairies that were acting like they were possessed by something ... that's bothering me.

???:
... ... there was a response from around here.

Nazrin:
Oh, it's that human from before. Boring.

Reimu:
I am not!

Nazrin:
Oh, please don't take that the wrong way. I was just looking for some treasure I detected around here.

Reimu:
Treasure? Were those rumors about the treasure ship true?

Nazrin:
Treasure ship? There's no such thing. 
Oh, wait, my little mice were reacting to you.

Reimu:
Well, I am a human treasure.

Nazrin:
My mice do like the taste of human flesh. 
They say that cheese just can't compare to certain other red foods.

Reimu:
Humans aren't delicious enough to be made fools of by mice. 
Hm, but those mice were looking for treasure, too. 
How suspicious ...

???:
Please wait just a minute. You're so fast~

Reimu:
Did you need something?

???:
Need? Well, I don't know ... It's just that humans flying through the sky are so unusual ... 
Er, I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just kind of interested, that's all.

Reimu:
Hm? It's just a normal umbrella monster. What's the matter?

Kogasa:
Well, I've been really bored lately ... 
Nobody's ever surprised by an umbrella flying all by itself ... 
Hm, it looks like you're not surprised, either.

Reimu:
Why do I have to be surprised by something like that?

Kogasa:
Oh, I remember the good old days. We youkai used to be rulers of the night, but ...

Reimu:
It's daytime right now ... ...

Kogasa:
If anyone were even a little surprised by me, they wouldn't be able to walk straight.

Reimu:
Yes, yes, that's enough of your old time stories. Would you mind please mov-...

Kogasa:
These days you have to punish someone a little to surprise them, don't you!?

Kogasa:
Booo~?

Reimu:
Yes, yes, that's enough bitterness from you.

Kogasa:
sob sob* Just what are we youkai, anyway?

Reimu:
Maybe you're luxury items? Well, now the boat's right in front of me.

???:
Fairies, humans, and all, everyone seems to be dropping by ... are they after the treasury?

Reimu:
Treasury? On this ship?

???:
Well, no point in arguing! I'll show no mercy to any sort of scoundrel!

???:
My word, to think that there were humans who won't run away at the sight of this fist ... ...

Reimu:
Is this really a treasure ship? There's nothing here, but ...

Reimu:
Oh, she ran away.

???:
Just what are you after? Treasure? Or perhaps my sister's power?

Reimu:
What am I after? I'm trying to figure out what this ship is after!

???:
Hm. It's nothing to be worried about. 
This looks like a ship to you, but it is a modernized, remodeled version of a certain old, miraculous building.

Ichirin:
Once this place is filled with treasure, I'll be able to bring about the great revival of my sister as I've so dearly wished.

Reimu:
Great revival? I don't like the sound of that.

Ichirin:
I won't let anyone get in my way until that happens.

Reimu:
This sister of yours ... ... She's a youkai, right?

Ichirin:
I wouldn't place her on the level of a youkai.

Reimu:
Hmm, maybe I'd better beat you before you can revive her.

Ichirin:
... what's that? You mean, that shrine maiden has ...¬†? 
Unzan tells me you've been collecting the flying treasure. Is this true?

Reimu:
What are you talking about?

Ichirin:
Unzan would have no reason to lie to me. You've been collecting the fragments flying through the sky, haven't you?

Reimu:
Well, if you're getting in my way, maybe that wish will come true.

Ichirin:
Ahaha, well, thank you for finding them for the mice! I'll take them all!

Ichirin:
How splendid. I hadn't thought there were still humans like this in this world.

Reimu:
There's nothing great about being praised by a youkai.

Ichirin:
Still, you don't even compare to the soles of my sister's feet.

Reimu:
It doesn't sound like it would be a good idea to let you revive your sister. 
I can't let youkai run around that I can't handle.

Ichirin:
Oh, are you saying you're going inside now?

Reimu:
But, there's nothing here ... How does this ship stay in the sky? 
Things I don't understand are generally no good. 
This ship must be an ill omen, too!

???:
Is someone there? A human ... ...¬†? Or have you also given up your humanity?

Reimu:
There you are. A youkai of ill omen.

???:
I-ill omen?

Reimu:
Tell me what this ship really is!

???:
Oh my, not so loud ... ... Are you sure you want to come onboard?

Reimu:
I'm already onboard.

Minamitsu:
I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.

Reimu:
Woah, the captain already? How convenient!

Minamitsu:
We don't take any passengers who have any lingering connection to this world; what about you?

Reimu:
Huh? You mean you're going to ... the world of the dead? I'm sick of seeing ships like that.

Minamitsu:
No, we're not going there. 
This ship is bound for Hokkai, the world where Hijiri is imprisoned.

Reimu:
Hokkai?

Minamitsu:
A corner of the infinite area of Makai. That's where Hijiri was sealed away.

Reimu:
Oh, I know about Makai. Is that where this ship is going?

Minamitsu:
In order to enter Hokkai, we need the treasure Hijiri left behind ... ... 
But, you happen to have appeared with it. I'll have you hand it over now!

Minamitsu:
How strong ... ... When did humans get this strong?

Reimu:
Hm, a compliment from a youkai ... ...

Minamitsu:
It makes me remember how Hijiri was human once, long ago.

Reimu:
Huh?

Minamitsu:
Humans get strong, don't they? The earth must be full of strong humans now.

Reimu:
Well, I don't know ... Wait, the ship isn't stopping.

Minamitsu:
Yes, it's in auto-mode. 
Since you came onboard with the treasure, we've been headed towards our final destination.

Reimu:
Huh? Just a-

Nazrin:
Hmm? So you came to Makai, too?

Reimu:
Hey, aren't you that ... That mouse that was looking for treasure? 
I guess I've got some treasure. That's why I got brought all the way here.

Nazrin:
Seems to be. That's why my dowsing responded to you. 
But, that's not the only treasure I've been looking for. 
Maybe I'll test the power of this Bishamonten pagoda on you before I hand it over to my master.

Reimu:
I'm glad I got out of Makai, but I can't go any farther. 
Hokkai must be under this barrier, but ... 
It's sealed with a seal I've never seen before. 
Just what's sealed away in here, anyway?

???:
You're the human who found the treasure, aren't you? 
You look greedier than I'd imagined.

Reimu:
How rude.

???:
I'm sorry, you're quite right. 
I simply thought that if you'd made it this far, maybe you were some sort of ascetic scholar.

Reimu:
Well, I do mean to learn a lot while I'm here.

Shou:
I am the representative of Bishamonten, a devotee of Hijiri's creed. 
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought, as well as the fragments of the Flying Storage you possess, 
We can break the seal here. We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

Reimu:
What's sleeping beneath this seal?

Shou:
Hm? You gathered all the treasure without even knowing that?

Reimu:
Of course I don't know!

Shou:
It's a human saint who helped both youkai and humans without distinction.

Reimu:
Saint?

Shou:
Yes. She was a wonderful person. Yet, for some reason humans sealed her away.

Reimu:
Hm, it's some kind of saint ...¬†? It's not some bad guy?

Shou:
The humans were so foolish.
The foolish humans wanted to deny the existence of anything that wouldn't benefit them, so ... 
Since she wanted to use Makai's power to help youkai, 
She was sealed away - for something as simple as that. Isn't that unreasonable?

Reimu:
Look, she was doing bad things, right? If she's a friend of youkai ... 
I'm going to have to beat you too, okay? You're a youkai, after all.

Shou:
Very well, if that's your idea of justice. 
However, if you've chosen to follow the wrong path ... 
Then you'll have to bear witness to the light of dharma which is even brighter here in Makai -- 
And bow down before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

Shou:
How splendid. I can see how you could have gathered the treasure.

Reimu:
Youkai have been complimenting me all day.

Shou:
That's because you've gathered the fragments of the Flying Storage and helped us revive Hijiri.

Reimu:
Not that I had any intention of doing so.

Shou:
Well, let's begin the preparations to lift the seal.

Reimu:
I- I guess I can't go back after coming all this way without seeing this Hijiri or whatever. 
I wouldn't be able to sleep without knowing.

Shou:
Splendid! You have a wonderful heart.

Reimu:
I can't sense anyone at all, but ... 
Anyway, what's *with* this world? 
All that ominous atmosphere from before is completely gone ... ... 
It's just creepy in the opposite way.

???:
O, the world of dharma is filled with light. Are you the one who liberated this world?

Reimu:
There she is. You're the person the youkai were trying to ... ...

???:
Oh, didn't you break the seal?

Reimu:
Well, uh, I guess that's the way it turned out, but ...

???:
Thank you very much. 
I never dreamed I'd be able to bathe in the light again like this.

Reimu:
So, who are you?

Byakuren:
My name is Byakuren. 
I was a monk a long, long time ago. 
You seem to be a shrine maiden, am I right? 
Did you come down here to admit that I wasn't wrong?

Reimu:
Hm. I'm a shrine maiden who punishes those who aid youkai! 
And I think you're a dangerous person who all the youkai respect.

Byakuren:
I see, then you'll seal me away again?

Reimu:
Yes, exactly!

Byakuren:
You ... really don't think the same way that I do, do you? 
That humans and youkai can live together as equals in the light of the Buddha ...

Reimu:
Th-there's no way!

Byakuren:
Then why did you lift the seal?

Reimu:
Well ... because it would've been scarier if the youkai did it! It would be better for me to lift it myself ...

Byakuren:
From now on, I'll have to make sure I can show my gratitude to those who freed me. 
I can't change your desire to eliminate all youkai. 
However, if you're going to seal me away again ‚Äï‚Äï

Byakuren:
I will resist you with all my strength.

Reimu:
Hmph, you should have said that from the start. 
After all, I'll beat anyone who's a friend to youkai!

Byakuren:
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple. 
How weak and rash you are! Now, namusan ‚Äï‚Äï¬†!

Marisa:
What the hell? 
Now I've learned the fact that I won't be able to catch a ship flying in the sky by flying just above the ground.

???:
There was a treasure response from over here ... ...

Nazrin:
What? It's that human from before. Boring ...

Marisa:
A treasure reaction? Is there treasure around here?

Nazrin:
Nope, that's not it. Looks like the response was coming from you. 
But humans have a rarity factor of 0, so I think I'll just ignore you.

Marisa:
I thought my body was relatively rare, though.

Nazrin:
Well, I'd better go find the next treasure, or I'll never hear the end of it from her.

Marisa:
Are you looking for treasure? Does it have anything to do with that treasure ship?

Nazrin:
Treasure ship? That thing floating up in the sky? 
Maybe it looks like a treasure ship, but it's not, now. 
Well, I don't have any business with humans, but ... 
Too bad for you, but it looks like my little mice are really hungry.

Marisa:
Just what was that mouse, anyway? 
Don't tell me the treasure ship got infested with mice? 
Well, I guess I'll have to go find out for myself.

???:
Please wait just a minute~

Marisa:
I can't wait. That ship is calling out to me.

???:
Oh, my, so you're just going to hurry right on? Well, I guess I'll leave you now, then.

Marisa:
... ... Wait. 
You're just going to leave? That's pretty suspicious.

Kogasa:
Well, I won't leave, then. I've got lots of time.

Marisa:
What's with you? Are you a patrol from that ship?

Kogasa:
Ship? That's got nothing to do with me. 
I'm just a cheerful youkai who lives to surprise people. 
So, be surprised--

Marisa:
Yeah, right.

Kogasa:
*sob*

Marisa:
If you're not related to that ship, please don't get in my way. I'm really busy right now.

Kogasa:
Hmm, will you be surprised if I do this?

Kogasa:
Booooo! Did that surprise you?

Marisa:
Not at all. All the other youkai in town are like you. Not a single one is interesting at all.

Kogasa:
*sniff* My reason to live as a youkai ...

Marisa:
I might be surprised if you could protect me from the rain with that umbrella you've got there.

Kogasa:
Oh, so you're saying to go back to square one! Maybe that's not a bad idea ...

Marisa:
Well, I caught up to the ship I was chasing, so, see you.

???:
Humans, fairies, and all, a real crowd is dropping in ... are they after the treasury?

Marisa:
A treasury? I like the sound of that.

???:
Well, no point in arguing! I'll show no mercy to any sort of scoundrel!

???:
Oh! To think that there are still humans that wouldn't run away after seeing this fist ...

Marisa:
So I guess this is a story where I'll get the treasure if I finish you off ...

Marisa:
... ... She got away.

???:
Just what are you after? Treasure? Or my sister's power?

Marisa:
Your sister, you say? 
... ... But more importantly, the treasure. Yeah.

???:
I knew it, you're just a common thief!

Ichirin:
I'm Ichirin, and I'm taking my sister's place guarding the treasure. 
I won't let any thieves in alive!

Marisa:
Ah ha ha! A thief? Just who do you think I am!?
I'm no simple thief! I'm a normal magician!

Ichirin:
And?

Marisa:
Well, I, uh ... So, please, don't worry about me, okay?

Ichirin:
... ... What? You mean, that girl in black has ...¬†?

Marisa:
Huh? What's wrong? Why are you talking to yourself?

Ichirin:
Unzan tells me you're gathering the fragments of the floating treasure.

Marisa:
Fragments of the secret treasure ...¬†? Well, I picked up some weird thing that was driving the fairies crazy ...

Ichirin:
I see asking the mice to search wasn't any use ...

Ichirin:
Thank you for finding them! Now I can finally revive my sister!

Ichirin:
How splendid. I can't believe there are humans like that in this world, too ...

Marisa:
I wouldn't lose to a youkai like you!

Ichirin:
If you're collecting the floating treasure, then you're trying to revive my sister too, right?

Marisa:
What's this secret treasure you're talking about? You mean these flying things the fairies were dropping?

Ichirin:
Very well, very well. You seem to be an ally, so ...

Marisa:
... ... What? Are these flying things actually worth something ...¬†?

Marisa:
Well, I think I get it. 
There's nothing on this ship. 
So, I guess I'll just have to take this flying treasure or whatever home and study it.

???:
Is someone there? A human ... ...¬†? Or have you also given up your humanity?

Marisa:
... ... A youkai? What *is* this ship, anyway?

???:
Oh, it looks like you've got something nice.

Marisa:
Hm? So, you're interested in this?

???:
Yes, as long as we have that, we can turn this ship towards its destination.

Marisa:
Destination?

Minamitsu:
Oh, where are my manners? I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin. 
This ship is bound for Hokkai, the world where Hijiri is imprisoned.

Marisa:
Did you say Hokkai? The heck's that?

Minamitsu:
A corner of the infinite area of Makai. That's where Hijiri was sealed away.

Marisa:
Makai ... ...

Minamitsu:
Are you afraid now?

Marisa:
No, I want to go to Makai. As a magician.

Minamitsu:
Magician? Hm, are you not human?

Marisa:
Well ... Well, anyway, mind taking me along?

Minamitsu:
Hehe, unfortunately we can't bring powerless passengers with us. 
Now, leave the treasure here and return back to earth!

Minamitsu:
You're strong ... ... Oh well, I suppose we'll let you board.

Marisa:
Uh, I'm already on board.
So, Makai ... ... You said we're going to Hokkai, so if I ride along, I'll get there, right?

Minamitsu:
Yes, since you brought the treasure, we've already under way.

Marisa:
The miasma usually makes it impossible to go there, but lots of interesting things have fallen into Makai. 
I guess this time I'll just bear it and go collect lots of rare items!

Minamitsu:
By the way, this ship is a one-way liner. 
We're not planning on leaving Makai ... ... Is that okay?

Marisa:
Wait, hang on! Stop the boat!

Nazrin:
Hmm? So you came to Makai, too?

Marisa:
Hmm? It's that mouse from before. I knew I could smell treasure in Makai.

Nazrin:
I've already found my treasure.

Marisa:
What? No fair, the barrier was holding me back so I couldn't get far into Makai.

Nazrin:
No, I wasn't looking for something from Makai. It's this jeweled pagoda, shining with the light of Buddha. 
Perfect timing. I'll test this treasure out on you.

Marisa:
Hmmm.
Hey, hey. It's great that I've gotten through Makai, but I can't get any farther down, can I? 
What's that? I don't understand this seal at all. 
I'll never be able to get any treasure or anything else at this rate.

???:
You're the human who gathered the flying treasure, yes? 
Now, let us begin.

Marisa:
Hmm? Do you know how I can get in here?

???:
Yes, I do. That's why you brought that, right? 
Those fragments of the Flying Storage.

Marisa:
Mm? Oh, uh, yeah.

Shou:
I am the representative of Bishamonten, a devotee of Hijiri's creed. 
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought, as well as the fragments of the Flying Storage you possess, 
We can break the seal here. We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

Marisa:
Oho, so, if you break this seal, then something will come out, right?

Shou:
Hm? You gathered all the treasure without even knowing that?

Marisa:
Oh, no, uh, I guess I just kinda forgot.

Shou:
Hm, from the looks of it, I'd say you never knew.

Marisa:
Tee hee.

Shou:
What led you here may be the power of the treasure that Hijiri left. 
However, you may be against her revival. You may be just a simple enemy ...

Marisa:
No, no, I just want to go down in there.

Shou:
Just a simple enemy ... ... 
Still, even if you are an enemy, there's no denying that you were chosen by the treasure. 
However, if you've chosen to follow the wrong path ... 
Then I'll have you bow down before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

Shou:
So your path is not a wrong one.

Marisa:
You're just sorry you lost.

Shou:
Now, let us prepare to lift the seal.

Marisa:
Y, yeah. That's right.
But first, there's something I wanna ask you.
What happens when you lift this seal, anyway?

Shou:
That's for Hijiri to worry about. It's none of our concern.

Marisa:
Hm, maybe I messed something up here.
If things go south, I'll have no choice but to take control of the situation.

Marisa:
Bweeeeh. 
There's nothing here in this world. 
Well, I guess it's Makai, that's for sure. 
There's magic power pouring out of everywhere here.

???:
O, the world of dharma is filled with light. Are you the one who liberated this world?

Marisa:
You ... ... I've been looking for you.

???:
Who on earth are you?

Marisa:
I'm Marisa the magician. I was curious, so I came all the way down here.

???:
I see, you're a magician ...

Marisa:
Who are you?

Byakuren:
My name is Byakuren. 
I was a monk a long, long time ago. 
Well, perhaps it would be more accurate to say I was a magician?

Marisa:
What? You're a magician? You're in the business?

Byakuren:
Yes, I suppose you could say that. 
Is that why you wanted to save me?

Marisa:
No, that wasn't what I had in mind, but ...

Byakuren:
But, that aside, has the world become a place where it's okay to use magic? 
In my time, because I could use strange powers ... 
People hated me, and in the end they sealed away me down here.

Marisa:
What? You were sealed away because you used magic?

Byakuren:
Yes, that's why I recognized youkai as equals and called on others to do the same. 
Will you support me in that?

Marisa:
In today's world ... ... I think it's okay to use magic. 
But, youkai and humans are not equal! 
Humans are weaker, so they need more protection! 
Saying youkai and humans are equal doesn't make it true. 
Especially coming from a youkai like you.

Byakuren:
I see; I've already given up my humanity. 
I suppose it's pointless for a non-human like me to appeal for equality.

Marisa:
That's right.

Byakuren:
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple. 
How superficial, greedy, and unjust you are! Now, namusan ‚Äï‚Äï¬†!

Marisa:
Hey, woah, this is turning out to be pretty amazing. 
It looks like that ship has come out to try to find me!

???:
No, no. It's not looking for you.

Nazrin:
It just brought me here, is all.

Marisa:
What's this? A mouse? Hey, I just saw you, too.

Nazrin:
I'm just looking for a little something. I came down because I picked up on a treasure response. 
Anyway, it looks like it was just reacting to you. What a letdown.

Marisa:
A mouse from a ship ... Don't tell me you've eaten through all the food supply already!

Nazrin:
That's not really a ship. Well, maybe it looks like one.

Marisa:
It sure does. I have good eyes, you know.

Nazrin:
Alright now, human. I've got some work to do, so ...

Marisa:
You're not getting away! If I let you get away, something bad will happen!

Nazrin:
I don't really want to fight you, but ... Oh, well.

Marisa:
Now! Tell me who you are! 
..., wait, what? Did she run away? 
She's a pretty fast mouse. Well, she's a mouse, after all.

???:
Please wait just a minute~ 
Where are you going in such a hurry?

Marisa:
Hey, I just ran into you, didn't I? 
It kinda makes it look like I'm chasing you.

Kogasa:
I'll leave that to you!

Marisa:
Well, what is it? What do you want with someone busy as me? A job?

Kogasa:
Well, uh, I've been really bored lately, and ...

Marisa:
Oho, are you bragging? Since I'm really busy ...

Kogasa:
Even if I try to startle humans, no-one's ever surprised. It's so boring.

Marisa:
Nobody would be surprised by a monster umbrella. 
A normal umbrella blown around by the wind would be scarier. It might run into you.

Kogasa:
I see! Bumping into people surprises them!

Marisa:
Er, no, that's not what I ...

Kogasa:
I'll smash you up, boooo!

Kogasa:
You smashed me up ...

Marisa:
Karakasa ghosts are really soft compared to normal umbrellas. 
Huh? Shouldn't that make you harder to break, though?

Kogasa:
Soft ... Oh, like konjac jelly!

Marisa:
Huh?

Kogasa:
I can use konjac jelly to surprise humans! It's perfect!

Marisa:
... this youkai's really behind the times.

???:
Humans, fairies, and all, a real crowd is dropping in ... are they after the treasury?

Marisa:
A treasury? Why's a treasury flying in the sky?

???:
Well, no point in arguing! I'll show no mercy to any sort of scoundrel!

???:
Oh! To think that there are still humans that wouldn't run away after seeing this fist ...

Marisa:
Look, I can't find an entrance to this ship anywhere ... Would you take me to it?

Marisa:
... ... She got away.

???:
Just what are you after? Treasure? Or my sister's power?

Marisa:
I can't see any treasure here.

???:
Yes, as you can see, it's all been lost. 
Most of the treasure was stolen by greedy thieves, even the flying treasures I need to revive my sister. 
It was carried away by fairies.

Marisa:
Well, that's too bad. However. 
It looks like something more interesting than treasure is sleeping here.

Ichirin:
Yes, that's right. She's still sleeping. 
If I can't find all my sister's flying treasures, I can't revive her.

Marisa:
Hm, well, why don't I help you? It sounds interesting.

Ichirin:
... ... what's that? You mean that girl in black has ...¬†?

Marisa:
What's the matter? Why did you start talking to yourself?

Ichirin:
Unzan tells me 
you've been gathering the fragments of the floating treasure.
I guess asking the mice to find it didn't work ...

Marisa:
What, you mean I've already been helping? What is this secret treasure, anyway ...

Ichirin:
Thank you for finding them! Now, you just need to hand them over!

Ichirin:
How splendid. I can't believe there are humans like that in this world, too ...

Marisa:
So what's this secret treasure?

Ichirin:
The flying treasure is my sister's most precious treasure. You saw it too, right?

Marisa:
Well, I saw something ...

Ichirin:
They're flying objects the fairies carry around sometimes.

Marisa:
Is she talking about those round UFOs ...¬†?

Marisa:
Hmmm ... Well, now, this is ... 
This place is totally empty. And there's totally no-one here. 
Just an abandoned place that's become a fairy hangout ... How does this thing even stay in the air? 
Maybe there was some kind of accident. It feels like a ghost ship.

???:
Is someone there?

Marisa:
Oh, guess I missed you. Someone's onboard after all.

???:
And who are you?

Marisa:
A magician that makes just crying kids shut up. How about you?

Minamitsu:
Oh, where are my manners? I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.

Marisa:
So the captain's here! Maybe that means this ship isn't just floating around. 
So, what'd you call this place, a holy ...¬†?

Minamitsu:
Yes, it was built to carry Hijiri about, so a holy palanquin. 
Of course, its only passengers nowadays are you, me, and a few youkai.

Marisa:
Huh, yeah, it's pretty empty. 
So, where's this ship headed? Why's it flying?

Minamitsu:
This ship is bound for Hokkai. We'll save Hijiri and create a new world.

Marisa:
Huh. I don't get it at all.

Minamitsu:
Actually, there's something I haven't told you. 
We need the treasures you have in order to reach our destination. 
You've let us gain considerable time on our journey there.

Marisa:
... ... what did you say?

Minamitsu:
Well, we'll be arriving shortly. I won't let you get away!

Minamitsu:
You're strong ... ... But I think we've made up enough time.

Marisa:
I didn't want to run away, you know. 
There's still a lot I don't know about this ship.

Minamitsu:
I see, then I suppose it's okay for me to resume service. We'll be arriving shortly.

Marisa:
Huh, it feels like it's easier to use magic now for some reason.

Minamitsu:
That's because we'll be entering Makai shortly.

Marisa:
D-did you say Makai?

Minamitsu:
Yes, Hokkai is a small part of Makai, so we need to go to Makai.
There's a miasma that's bad for your body floating about, but it makes magic stronger.
That's why Hijiri's seal is so strong, too.

Marisa:
Well now, I wonder who the heck would be sealed away in a place like that?

Nazrin:
Hmm? So you came to Makai, too?

Marisa:
Oh, it's that mouse from before! 
If you're here, too, you must have something to do with that ship.

Nazrin:
I heard that you had one of the treasures I was looking for. 
I've been looking for another treasure - it's a secret from the captain. 
My master carelessly lost it, so she was probably too embarrassed to tell anyone but me. 
So, why don't I try using this jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten?

Marisa:
Well now. 
I've never seen a seal like this before. Looks like this isn't the usual kind. 
I guess you need this treasure(?) I found to break the seal, but ... 
Are these UFOs really treasure?

???:
Yes, I've been waiting for you. 
We can break the seal with the flying treasure you've brought.

Marisa:
Who're you?

Shou:
I am the representative of Bishamonten, a devotee of Hijiri's creed. 
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought, as well as the fragments of the Flying Storage you possess, 
We can break the seal here. We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

Marisa:
These UFOs ... are part of the Flying Storage? What's that?

Shou:
Hm? You gathered all the treasure without even knowing that?

Marisa:
Yeah, by the time I realized what happened.

Shou:
As its name suggests, it's a storage that flies through the sky. 
It was a warehouse filled with the lord brother's miraculous power. 
That power was strong enough that with just a touch, it raise one's physical ability and can cause them to fly through the sky.

Marisa:
Oh?

Shou:
The warehouse had been sealed away deep underground with us for several hundred years. 
However, this winter, were were suddenly freed by a geyser welling up. 
Then, the fragments of the Flying Storage were scattered as the geyser spewed out.

Marisa:
A geyser? That's right, there's been frequent geyser eruptions since last winter, I wonder why.

Shou:
When we were awakened from underground, the fragments had already been scattered by fairies. 
We need Myouren's magic in order to break Hijiri's seal. 
However, the only thing with any of it left are the fragments of the silo.

Marisa:
I don't really get it, but these UFOs are important, right? They're valuable, right? 
They were making those fairies go berserk, too. I wanna take them home and study them.

Shou:
You can't take them now. We need them in order to break the seal. 
We can't let you take the treasure and use them for some fiendish purpose. 
I didn't want to do this, but I have no choice. 
The light of this jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten will cleanse the evil from your heart!

Shou:
Well, I can see how you could have collected the treasure. At this rate ... ...

Marisa:
Wait, no need for you to worry. I want to help you break the seal.

Shou:
I see, then you are a comrade.

Marisa:
In return, if everything works out, could you share some of this treasure with me?

Shou:
Um ... ... yes, I promise. But only one, okay? 
They're very valuable.

Marisa:
Yes!

Marisa:
Wow ... 
There's so little here it's surprising. 
I want to go home and go investigate those Flying Storage pieces or whatever. 
Maybe I'll sneak out before anything shows up.

???:
O, the world of dharma is filled with light. Are you the one who liberated this world?

Marisa:
Meh, she found me. 
Better prepare myself for the worst.

???:
I feel powerful again for the first time in a long time. Thank you very much. 
I'd like to reward you, of course ... But alas, there's nothing here in Hokkai.

Marisa:
Did you say reward me? By the way, who are you?

Byakuren:
My name is Byakuren. 
I was a monk a long, long time ago. 
Well, perhaps it would be more accurate to say I was a magician?

Marisa:
Hm, so you're in the business too ... 
I'd really like that reward now, though.

Byakuren:
In the business? Can you also use magic?

Marisa:
Yep, that's right.

Byakuren:
Then I'll have to think on it; it won't do if I give you something you could do yourself ... 
Does this mean we've reached an age where magic is widely used? 
In my time as a human, because I could use strange powers ... 
People hated me, and in the end they sealed away me down here.

Marisa:
What? You were sealed away because you used magic? 
In today's world ... ... I think it's okay to use magic, but ...

Byakuren:
Oh, thank goodness. Then I truly will be free. I'll have to return to our world and work hard.

Marisa:
Hang on a sec, work hard at what? What are you after?

Byakuren:
I want to appeal for human and youkai equality, and bring peace to the world.

Marisa:
... equality?

Byakuren:
I'll save the oppressed youkai. That is my chosen calling as a magician.

Marisa:
Now, wait. I can't let you do that. 
It's humans that are oppressed in today's world. Youkai are running rampant. 
A youkai like you should just be quiet and give me my reward.

Byakuren:
I see; I've already given up my humanity. 
I suppose it's pointless for a non-human like me to appeal for equality.

Marisa:
That's right.

Byakuren:
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple. 
What a narrow-minded boor you are! Now, namusan ‚Äï‚Äï¬†!

Sanae:
Nothing's going to be solved by me chasing this flying ship...
I think I saw some weird fairy earlier, I wonder if that had any special meaning...?

???:
There was a reaction from the treasure around here......

Sanae:
Eek! You scared me. Are you that mouse from before?

Nazrin:
Oh, it's that human, isn't it? Hm, maybe I was wrong.
Please don't get in the way of my work.

Sanae:
Your work? But you're just a mouse.
Just a mouse that couldn't make it through the winter, even after eating all the rice in our storeroom...

Nazrin:
What are you saying? Don't make fun of us mice!
... huh. It looks like that reaction was coming from you.
That's really disappointing. I guess I'll go look for treasure somewhere else.

Sanae:
That's right, We shouldn't make fun of even mice.
They are a precious living being required for scientific experiments in the outer world.

Nazrin:
Sorry, but if you don't take us mice seriously, you'll die.

Sanae:
Oh!
So this is youkai hunting!
...... This is kind of fun.

???:
Hang on just a minute~

Sanae:
Yes, what is it?

???:
Booooooo„Éº!

Sanae:
......
Er, did you need something?

Kogasa:
...... Oh, I'm so lonely.
Won't you at least be a little surprised?

Sanae:
Well, I guess I'm used to things like that.

Kogasa:
Aw, and we youkai are doing our best to surprise humans...

Sanae:
Hmm? I heard you were doing your best to eat humans......

Kogasa:
Well, there are youkai that eat meat, and there are youkai who eat your spirit.
If you humans don't get surprised by me, I'll get hungry.

Sanae:
That must be hard on you. But, well, since I'm starting to see how this is fun, getting surprised would be...

Kogasa:
Fun?

Sanae:
Yes, how fun youkai hunting is.

Kogasa:
Oh, what's the point of youkai who can't surprise people?

Sanae:
Well, now, please don't get so down.

Kogasa:
Maybe I should go back to being a normal umbrella...

Sanae:
I don't know if anyone would want an old umbrella that looks like an eggplant...

Kogasa:
That's right, that's how I became an unwanted youkai. Oh, such terrible old memories......

Sanae:
Oh my, it looks like I said something I shouldn't have.

???:
Humans, fairies... a mob is gathering. Are you after the treasury?

Sanae:
Huh? Treasury?

???:
No use arguing about it! I won't show any mercy to burglars!

???:
My word, to think that there were humans who won't run away at the sight of this fist......

Sanae:
But I'm not looking for a treasury, I'm just looking for youkai to hunt.

Sanae:
Wait, why are you running away?

???:
If you're hunting youkai, do it back on the ground.

Sanae:
But youkai hunting is something you do to youkai! You're a youkai, right?

???:
Well, yes.

Sanae:
......
Better prepare yourself!

Ichirin:
I'm living in peace, so can't you leave me alone?
You, are you really okay with killing youkai?

Sanae:
Uuugh. I have to do it to complete my great mission.

Ichirin:
Humans have gotten so selfish of late.
And yet, even though my own sister was once a human, she works so hard for youkai......
...... what? You mean that shrine maiden has...?
Unzan tells me you're collecting the floating fragments.

Sanae:
Huh? What are you talking about now?

Ichirin:
I'm sorry, I must have mistaken you for someone else.
You've been working to help revive my sister, yes? Then we're comrades with the same objective.

Sanae:
Huh? Er, no, I...

Ichirin:
Thank you for finding all those floating gems! Now, please hand them over!

Ichirin:
How splendid. I can't believe there are humans like this in this world, too.

Sanae:
You're quite a worthy youkai yourself. That was pretty satisfying.
I hope all the youkai from here on out are like you.

Ichirin:
If you're not going to give me the floating gems you've found...
Then, you want to revive her on your own, right?
Well, please, go right on ahead inside!

Sanae:
Yep, there's definitely some great youkai to hunt inside.

Sanae:
Hmm. There's nobody here but fairies......
I was expecting a youkai hideout to be more active with stronger enemies.
Even all the ornaments are old-fashioned and plain...
Isn't there anyone here?

???:
Is someone there?

Sanae:
There you are. Speak of the devil!

???:
And who are you?

Sanae:
I've come to exterminate youkai. My name is Sanae Kochiya.

Murasa:
I'm Murasa, the captain of the Palanquin Ship.
We don't need any youkai exterminators at the moment.

Sanae:
Oh, you're the captain? Is it okay for you to be wandering around a place like this?

Murasa:
Yes, the ship is headed for its destination automatically now.
Actually, there's not much for me to do as captain these days.

Sanae:
I see, it's kind of like the bullet trains. Well, then, I'd better hurry up and...

Murasa:
And what?

Sanae:
Well, ummm, you know, exterminate youkai. You're a youkai, aren't you?

Murasa:
I am!
But, that troublesome youkai hunting of yours will be over soon.

Sanae:
Huh?

Murasa:
The future that Hijiri wants is a peaceful, beautiful youkai world.
And, we'll be able to break Hijiri's seal with the treasure you've brought.

Sanae:
Huuh? A world without youkai hunting? That's not good.

Murasa:
If you stay on board with the treasure you have, we can take you along to Makai.
We'll be there before long. I won't let you get away!

Murasa:
I can see you're not just in this business for show.

Sanae:
What's the treasure I've got?

Murasa:
They're objects that can fly on their own. They used to be part of a grain silo, though...

Sanae:
Oh, so it's not a UFO-shaped toy?

Murasa:
UFO?

Sanae:
Ummm, let's see, what was it? Unidentified flying object, right?

Murasa:
Yes, it's exactly that. That's our flying treasure, the fragments of the Flying Storage.

Sanae:
So the UFOs were actually parts of a grain silo. Those magazines I used to read tricked me...

Murasa:
It's the one treasure left behind by the legendary brother. Well, I can see our destination now.

Nazrin:
Hmm? So you came to Makai, too?

Sanae:
Ah! The mouse! I see you're still alive!

Nazrin:
I can't be done in that easily.

Sanae:
This time you won't be getting up again! You're pretty weak, after all.

Nazrin:
Hey, now, I've still got work to do.
I can't let you do me in until I hand over this treasure pagoda.
Why don't you let me borrow a little of your power for this treasure that will light the world with the power of dharma!

Sanae:
Where on Earth am I...? This is just too creepy...
I've never been in a place with this kind of atmosphere. I've never seen boundaries like this.
Why did I let them bring me to a place like this?

???:
I've been waiting for you!
With the flying treasure that you have, we can break this seal.

Sanae:
Huh? Who're you?

Shou:
I'm the representative of Bishamonten, a devotee of Hijiri's creed.
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought, as well as the fragments of the Flying Storage you possess,
We can break the seal here. We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

Sanae:
Hmm... that's right, the UFO was part of a silo. People will be talking about this for a long time...

Shou:
Now, come, let us break the seal together.

Sanae:
Hm, let's see, I'm worried about that seal, but...... First I have to vanquish the youkai in front of me, right?

Shou:
Youkai? Do you mean me?

Sanae:
Is there anyone else here?

Shou:
You believe youkai hunting is justice, eh?
A lot of people seem to think that way.

Sanae:
I've come here to straighten out anyone without the proper reverence for God!

Shou:
It's true that I'm a youkai, but I'm also a devotee of Bishamonten.

Sanae:
Wh, what?
But, I'll try to defeat you anyway!

Shou:
I see, very well, then! You have your own sense of justice.
However, if the path you've chosen isn't correct...
Then you'll have to bear witness to the light of dharma which is even brighter here in Makai‚Äî
And bow down before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

Shou:
I've lost... I suppose that means what you're doing isn't wrong.

Sanae:
So you lost!
That's the power of the living god, Sanae Kochiya!

Shou:
So, then, what will you do now?
This is Makai, after all, and the ship that could take you back home is out of energy.

Sanae:
Huh?

Shou:
I think it would be easy for you to get home with Hijiri's aid, but...

Sanae:
I, I see. I don't know who she is, but I suppose I'll have to help you revive this Hijiri.
Oh, Lady Kanako... What should I do now?
......
...... yes. I'll go see this sealed person, and if she's dangerous, I'll just beat her!

Shou:
So, you'll help us?

Sanae:
Yes! Let's do it!

Shou:
By the way, Hijiri used to be human, too, so she should be willing to help you...
Will you still be able to exterminate a "youkai" like that?

Sanae:
Where am I......?
It's like that ill-omened place before never existed.
I wonder what kind of person would get sealed away in a place like this...

???:
O, the world of dharma is filled with light.
Are you the one who liberated this world?

Sanae:
Oh, there you are.
Ummm, I'd like you to take me back to my world.

???:
Hmmm? That would probably be easy, but......
I'd have expected the breaker of the seal to ask for something more.

Sanae:
Yes, well, before I knew it, here I was... By the way, who are you?

Byakuren:
My name is Byakuren.
I was a Buddhist monk a long, long time ago.
You seem to be a shrine maiden, am I right?

Sanae:
Yes, I'm a shrine maiden that hunts youkai.

Byakuren:
A youkai hunter...?

Sanae:
Yes, I hunt youkai who do bad things to people.

Byakuren:
...... I see humans haven't changed.

Sanae:
I'm sorry?

Byakuren:
I grieve for the youkai that are oppresed by humans.
I did everything in my power to create a peaceful world where humans and youkai could live as equals.
And yet, I was sealed away by humans who didn't want that sort of world.

Sanae:
Humans and youkai, as equals?

Byakuren:
Yes. Gods and buddhas are no different from youkai.
Yet, why are youkai reviled and hunted, while gods are worshipped?
It is only because humans want it to be so.

Sanae:
Did you say gods and youkai aren't any different?
That's not true at all!

Byakuren:
Do you believe hunting youkai is just?

Sanae:
Yes, of course! We have to hunt youkai to keep the peace!
That's what Lady Kanako said, too!

Byakuren:
I see; then, as someone who's given up on humans...
I suppose you would see me no different than a youkai.

Sanae:
Then, I guess it's time to beat you!

Byakuren:
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple.
You're only blindly following her, how superficial! Now, namusan --¬†!

Sanae:
It looks like that ship is just going back and forth...
It's hard to say it was just patrolling. It looked like it was chasing me earlier.

???:
It's not trying to catch you.

???:
It's looking for a response from the treasure.

Sanae:
Ee! A mouse, a mouse!

Nazrin:
... huh? What a disappointing development.
It looks like the treasure responses were coming from you. Well, I guess if there's a human around here ...

Sanae:
What are you talking about? Were you looking for me?

Nazrin:
Why would I be doing that?
It'd be bad if my little mice got responses from humans. They're just a bunch of walking stomachs.

Sanae:
Do mice eat humans?
Ahahaha~ Are you for real?

Nazrin:
Yes. That happens.
You're a pretty strange human to not be afraid of mice.

Sanae:
Hmm, hmm. So mice in Gensokyo eat humans.
Maybe it would be nice if humans ate mice, too.
... ...
No, that would be too weird ...

???:
Please wait just a minute~

Sanae:
Yes, what is it?

???:
Urameshiyaaaaa„Éº!

Sanae:
... ...
Is this youkai making fun of humans?

???:
Urameshiya?

Sanae:
Yes, yes. And out front is a soba store.

Kogasa:
... doesn't looking at me make you surprised?

Sanae:
In this day and age you can fly a little helicopter inside someone's room.
These days, nobody would be surprised by something like a flying umbrella.

Kogasa:
What, you mean I'm behind the times?

Sanae:
Well, you've got that crazy made-up personality. Even if you didn't, though, ghost umbrellas are kind of behind the times.
Anyway, what's with that umbrella? It's the same color as an eggplant ...

Kogasa:
*sniff sniff* And I did my best to look youkai-like.
I guess I was thrown out because the design was a little off ... ...
I thought I'd try to get back at the human who threw me away, and I turned into a youkai ... ...

Sanae:
Um, excuse me? Did I say something wrong?

Kogasa:
It's okay. This is how youkai get lonely and disappear.

Sanae:
U-um, look, I didn't mean it like that ... ...
It's just, if I got an umbrella like that from a friend, I just thought maybe I'd rather say no and go home wet ...

Kogasa:
Fine, if you can't understand the feelings of a youkai like me, then why don't you just go melt in the acid rain!

Kogasa:
Oh, I can't stand this.

Sanae:
So, it's not just mice. Even umbrellas won't take me seriously.
It's the end of me ... What happened to my dignity as a human ...¬†?

Kogasa:
Crap! I ought to go down and mess up your shrine a little!

Sanae:
Oh, my, you shouldn't be self-destructive.
I'll have to really exterminate you if you do that.

???:
Humans, fairies, and all, a real crowd is dropping in ... are they after the treasury?

Sanae:
Hm? The treasury?

???:
Well, no point in arguing! I'll show no mercy to any sort of scoundrel!

???:
My word, to think that there were humans who won't run away at the sight of this fist ... ...

Sanae:
That's right. Even humans do what they have to.

Sanae:
Wait, don't run off!

???:
Just what are you after? Treasure? Or my sister's power?

Sanae:
I'm just doing an investigation. It's very academic.

???:
Aca-demic?
Oh, I see, you're a ruffian who's using science as a pretext to rampage around ruins.

Sanae:
... ...oh, is that how it is?

Ichirin:
I'm in charge of guarding this place's treasure from that kind of person.

Sanae:
And you've been doing a wonderful job, too.

Ichirin:
You're included in "that kind of person"!

Sanae:
I just wanted to perform an academic investigation ...

Ichirin:
Like I said, it's the same. You're just a common thief.
... what's that? You mean that shrine maiden has ...¬†?
Unzan tells me you're collecting the flying treasure.

Sanae:
The fragments of the secret treasure?

Ichirin:
I'm sorry, I must have mistaken you for someone else.
You've been gathering the fragments that the fairies carried off, haven't you? And yet, not knowing that, I've been so rude ...

Sanae:
Huh? Huh? What's going on?

Ichirin:
Now, if you'll just hand over the flying treasure, I can fulfill my greatest wish!

Ichirin:
How splendid. I can't believe there are humans like that in this world, too ...

Sanae:
Secret treasure ...¬†?
Are you talking about those charms with "P" and "point" written on them?

Ichirin:
Please, go on inside with the flying treasure you've found.
That will bring about my sister's resurrection.

Sanae:
Huh? Can I go inside?
Well, here I go, then.

Sanae:
What is this place ...¬†?
I thought the insides of a flying ship would be more mechanical, but ...
It's all old-fashioned, like a deserted house.
I'd better get serious and do a full-blown investigation or I won't get anywhere.

???:
Is someone there?

Sanae:
Woah! You scared me!

???:
Oh, a human? And to think she's brought the flying treasure ...

Sanae:
Flying treasure? The youkai before was talking about that, too.
What is it, anyway?

???:
It's treasure that we need to resurrect Hijiri.
We had the mouse out searching for it, but ... What's she off getting into, anyway?

Sanae:
Mouse ... I think I've seen one recently ...
Oh, that youkai who was talking about eating people?
Hmm, it got on my nerves how she was making fun of humans.

Murasa:
Oh, where are my manners? I'm Murasa, the captain of this holy palanquin.
I'm glad you brought us the flying treasures ...
But I'd rather not have a human that's still attached to this world onboard.

Sanae:
Hm? I just came to do some investigation.

Murasa:
Please, leave the treasures here and disembark immediately.

Sanae:
Hm, are you also trying to make fun of humans?
I won't let you do that!
You all won't take me seriously because Reimu and her friends are off somewhere goofing around!

Murasa:
Does this mean ...
You have no intention of leaving?

Sanae:
I'll beat you and restore our human dignity!

Murasa:
Well, then, that's fine.
I was going to fight you to take the treasures by force, anyway.

Murasa:
You're strong ... Who are you, anyway?

Sanae:
I'm Sanae Kochiya, a human who's also a living god!
I won't lose to any youkai!

Murasa:
I see ... so you're a god. I can see why you're so strong, then.
Well ... please excuse me for deceiving you with my talk of disembarking.

Sanae:
Huh?

Murasa:
I was really just trying to buy time by provoking you into fighting so you wouldn't leave with the treasure.

Sanae:
Oh, really?

Murasa:
We'll arrive at our destination soon safely carrying the treasure.
This ship won't be going back. It looks like you're a citizen of the demons' land now, too.

Nazrin:
Hmm? So you came to Makai, too?

Sanae:
Oh, it's the mouse!
The captain was looking for you, you know? Saying, "where's she wandering off to now?" ...

Nazrin:
Oh? Really? Actually, I've had to look for something else - it's a secret to the captain.
I was looking for the flying treasure you happened to find, but also for this jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten.
I finally found it in a second-hand goods shop. It cost me an arm and a leg, though.

Sanae:
Hmm ...
Oh, now I remember. You were talking about eating people before.
It's payback time now!

Nazrin:
You're pretty funny. This pagoda is really my master's, but let's see how much light it can shine!

Sanae:
It's hard to believe there's a world like this ...
I couldn't tell where we were going in the ship; this place seems pretty unstable, though.
Is this the world where demons live ...¬†?

???:
Yes. This is Makai.

Sanae:
Huh? Makai?

???:
The horrible, unearthly nature of Makai makes it an unsuitable place for most living creatures.
However, some of the youkai train here, and humans could learn magic here.

Sanae:
Just who are you?

Shou:
I am the representative of Bishamonten, and a devotee of Hijiri's creed.
Now that we have the jeweled pagoda Nazrin brought, as well as the fragments of the Flying Storage you possess,
We can break the seal here. We can repay our debt of gratitude to Hijiri.

Sanae:
Who is Hijiri?

Shou:
Hijiri is a holy person.
As far as I know, she is the most exemplary human with the most compassionate heart.
Because Hijiri sought the power of Makai, some foolish humans sealed her away.
Now, come, let us break the seal together.

Sanae:
Mmm, it looks like this is just going to turn into me breaking the seal?
 
... ...
I'm a little worried about that~ What kind of person is this Hijiri?
But, before that ... I'm not sure you're such a devoted youkai.
I'll be the one to break that seal. And I'll take that jeweled pagoda or whatever!

Shou:
Will you? It would be wonderful if you broke the seal.
However, if your heart is wicked ...
Then you'll have to bear witness to the light of dharma which is even brighter here in Makai --
And bow down before this pagoda of Bishamonten!

Shou:
I lost ... What you're doing is not wrong.

Sanae:
Great! Now, lend me that pagoda!

Shou:
Just for a while, okay? Don't run off with it, okay?

Sanae:
Okay, there, and now I'll just ...
... ...
Um, how am I supposed to break the seal?

Shou:
Look, like this~ You have to twist this like that.

Sanae:
Wow, the seal's disappearing ... ...

Shou:
Ah, the wind is blowing into Hokkai for the first time in hundreds of years!

Sanae:
Well, the seal's broken now.
I guess it's okay, since it's all investigative.
If I investigate the person who was sealed here really carefully, Lady Suwako should be happy when I get back.

???:
O, the world of dharma is filled with light.
Are you the one who liberated this world?

Sanae:
Oh, are you the person who was sealed away in here?

???:
Yes, I am.

Sanae:
Just who are you?

Byakuren:
My name is Byakuren.
I was a Buddhist monk a long, long time ago.
You seem to be a shrine maiden, am I right?

Sanae:
Yes, I am. Actually, I'm also a god, too.

Byakuren:
A god ...¬†? What would a god be doing in the depths of Makai?

Sanae:
I was investigating a ship flying through the sky, and before I knew it, here I was.

Byakuren:
Hmm, I see ... How did you break the seal here?
This seal was a very special seal.
It was sealed with the only piece of treasure left by my brother, Myouren.
With that treasure buried underground, I've been completely trapped.
Just how did you break the seal?

Sanae:
Well, you know, this and that happened, and ...

Byakuren:
You must be someone remarkable.

Sanae:
Of course, I'm a god.
I understand the youkai were all trying to revive you, but why?

Byakuren:
The youkai ... were there perhaps a tiger, a Ship Phantom, and a Nyuudo?

Sanae:
Mmm, that's about right.

Byakuren:
I see ... so they all still miss me ...
Even though I haven't been able to do anything for them for over a thousand years ...

Sanae:
Help them?
Are you a friend of the youkai?

Byakuren:
A friend ... yes, I suppose I am, but I'm also a friend to humans.
I want to create a world where humans and youkai live as equals.
I don't know if a god like you could understand, but I want to see the oppressed youkai regain their status.

Sanae:
Equals? Oppressed?
Whichever way you look at it, humans are the ones being oppressed!
I want to see humans regain their status!

Byakuren:
I see, it's too bad a living god couldn't see it my way.
However, I don't distinguish between youkai and gods.

Sanae:
The wholesome gods hunt the wicked youkai!

Byakuren:
Humans haven't changed since my days in the temple.
How self-righteous; you're an evil drag on us all! 
Now, namusan --¬†!

Kogasa:
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

Reimu:
Wow, there's lots of clouds out now.
Where's that little snake? Looks like I lost it.
It looks like there's lots of UFOs around here, though. I'm sure there's someone suspicious around here.
Hm? I thought I heard something.
A bird? No, this voice... it can't be...!

???:
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting would be the one to find the fragments of the Soaring Vault.

Reimu:
This voice of misfortune! It's the mysterious youkai from ancient times...
It's the voice of the nue!

Nue:
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai to save that monk,
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

Reimu:
So here it is, the mysterious flying youkai.

Nue:
I hardly ever show myself before humans, you know?
You've just spent too much time sniffing around for me.
I suppose a human who could go all the way to Makai and back like it was nothing is special.

Reimu:
What are those UFOs?

Nue:
I put the Seed of Unknown Form in the Soaring Vault.
The seed has the power to change shape into something its observer can understand.
In other words, the UFO you saw was just a figment of your imagination..

Reimu:
Really? It's not easy to believe it would look different to different people.

Nue:
Oh, really? But, you know......
That's what happened to people when they saw me- they all had different descriptions, right?

Reimu:
Well, a nue has the head of a cat, the body of a chicken, and the tail of a snake, right?

Nue:
Sure. But, I've never looked like that when people saw me.
People have different perspectives, so even the form I take has gotten quite vague over the years.
It makes things very difficult. Well, it's also convenient.

Reimu:
Convenient?

Nue:
As a youkai whose specialty is being mysterious, it makes it easy to play on people's fears.

Nue:
But now that you've seen me, I'll have to bury you so I can go back to being an unknown.

Reimu:
Hmph, so that's how it is!
Let's see what the legendary mysterious youkai is really made of!

Nue:
You human who's forgotten the fear of night! Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

Nue:
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl, even if I've been asleep for so long......

Reimu:
I guess anyone who doesn't want to show their true form isn't all that, even if they're a legendary youkai.
Were you hiding out because you're so weak?

Nue:
The only reason I've been hiding for so long is because I was shut away underground!
A long time ago, I was beaten by a cruel human.

Reimu:
You did something bad, right?

Nue:
I just made them afraid.
That's what youkai do, there's no helping it.

Reimu:
Nobody likes scary things.
It's natural a youkai like that would be hunted down.

Nue:
But, you have bravery contests, right? Aren't there people who like being afraid?

Reimu:
W-well, that's different.

Nue:
Ahhh, my true form has been uncovered by an unidentified shrine maiden.
What am I going to do now?

Reimu:
Anyway, you need to fix all those seeds of unknown form you scattered around.
It'll be easier for Byakuren's group to find the other pieces of the Soaring Vault that way, right?

Nue:
Why do I have to help that monk......?

Reimu:
Well, she's a friend of youkai, right?

Nue:
Huh?

Reimu:
Especially youkai like you who were sealed away by humans.

Nue:
I didn't know Byakuren was like that.
But, I got in Murasa's way, even though she was trying to help Byakuren.
I'm the one that scattered the Soaring Vault everywhere. I can't show myself in front of them anymore.

Reimu:
Well, do whatever you want. I won't seal you away for now, but...
At least, just for now, okay?
After all, I'm no friend of yours.

Nue:
Hm, I'll just have fun scaring some humans.

Kogasa:
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

Reimu:
Wow, there's lots of clouds out now.
Where's that little snake? Looks like I lost it.
It looks like there's lots of UFOs around here, though. I can just break open another one if I have to.
Hm? I thought I heard something.
A bird? No, this voice... it can't be...!

???:
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting would be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Storage.

Reimu:
This voice of misfortune! It's the mysterious youkai from ancient times...
It's the cry of the nue!

Nue:
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai
to save that monk,
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those
imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

Reimu:
So, that shape-shifting snake and those mysterious UFOs were all the work of the nue too, right?

Nue:
Yes, wasn't it a nice show?
But, you humans were the only ones who thought
the fragments of the Flying Storage were UFOs.
Some people saw them as pieces of wood, some as birds, others as beasts.
Maybe some people even saw them as danmaku.
Well, humans have amazing imaginations.

Reimu:
What were you after? Wait, did you follow me all the way to Makai?

Nue:
Oh, did you notice?

Reimu:
Well, anyone would think a weird shiny orb following them is strange.

Nue:
Well, I was just having so much fun watching you.

Reimu:
So, what were you after?

Nue:
I just want to scare people. That's why I ravaged the old world with the fear of my unknown form.
I haven't been above ground in a long time. I had a lot of fun before my true form was revealed.

Reimu:
You haven't been above ground...? Are you another one of those underground youkai?

Nue:
It was terrible when my true form was revealed. Since this appearance was not dreadful at all,
I got locked in the underground after that.

Reimu:
It's too bad the underground got opened up...... It's been one disgusting youkai after another.

Nue:
I don't want to ever be shut up in such a dark and cramped place again, thank you!

Nue:
Now that you've found out my true form, I'll use all my powers to keep you quiet!

Reimu:
So you want to fight, huh?
Let's see what the legendary sealed youkai is really made of!

Nue:
You human who's forgotten the fear of night! Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

Nue:
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl, even if I've been asleep for so long......

Reimu:
Wow, you're really weak. Well, time to seal you away again.
Where would be good this time? Maybe I should take you to Hokkai instead of Byakuren?
You won't be able to get back from there so easily.

Nue:
No, I don't want to be sealed away again„Éº

Reimu:
...... I'm just kidding.
Youkai are free to wander the earth these days.
Of course, we're also free to hunt them.

Nue:
Really?
I won't get sealed away just for being a youkai? I won't get banished for massacring humans?

Reimu:
Yes, you will.

Nue:
Huh? What's the point, then?

Reimu:
Well, that youkai-friendly monk built a temple.

Nue:
Monk? You mean Byakuren?

Reimu:
Yes, I think she'd be willing to help even a nue.
Even if the humans shunned you.

Nue:
I didn't know Byakuren was like that... Oops.

Reimu:
Huh?

Nue:
Well, I got in Murasa's way, even though she was trying to help Byakuren.
I'm the one who scattered the Flying Storage fragments. I hope she doesn't get mad, but......

Reimu:
I bet she'll really put you through the wringer.

Nue:
I'll have to go use my cute little familiars to find all the pieces before she realizes it was me.

Reimu:
Don't worry, I'll tell her everything. Some facts, and some lies...

Nue:
You fiend.

Kogasa:
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

Marisa:
Where'd it disappear to?
It changed into a bird, and a monster...... What was that thing riding in that UFO?
It sure feels like some youkai that isn't related to Byakuren at all is behind this.
Huh? What's that weird animal cry?
Sounds kind a like a monster, or a bird, or a baby. This sound... it's...!

???:
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting would be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Storage.

Marisa:
I've never heard the voice of the youkai nobody's really seen before.
A nue! Was that weird orb of light you?

Nue:
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai to save that monk.
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

Marisa:
Huh?
I thought the nue had the head of a monkey, the body of a racoon dog, the limbs of a tiger and the tail of a snake?

Nue:
Well, you yourself said it, right? Nobody knows what I really look like.

Marisa:
Oh yeah, I did.

Nue:
So why would people know what I look like?

Marisa:
Well, there's an old legend...

Nue:
I hardly ever show my true form to humans.
Because I know the most effective way of scaring humans is to make sure they don't know what you really are.

Marisa:
Too bad someone does now. Me!

Nue:
That's because you found me out by following the Seed of Unknown Form hidden in the Flying Storage.

Nue:
I was just thinking... I'd better do something before you hurt my true form.

Marisa:
Hm, you wanna go?
I'll ask you all about what the UFOs really are after I beat you!

Nue:
You human who's given up imagination for knowledge! Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

Nue:
I-I can't believe I lost to such an unidentifiable human!

Marisa:
Huh, looks like you were the one who's afraid of the unknown.

Nue:
Well, what are you after? Are you going to lock me away again?

Marisa:
Lock you away? Nah, not my style.
I'm more interested in these UFOs. Apparently Byakuren didn't see them as UFOs, though.
What the heck are they, then?

Nue:
They're fragments of the flying silo that have the Seed of Unknown Form stuck in them.
The seed denies the object's true nature.
It's a part of me that makes the observer recognize it as something else they've seen before instead.

Marisa:
What's that mean?

Nue:
When you saw an unfamiliar flying object, you thought it was a flying saucer.
So, you just thought it was a UFO.

Marisa:
Oh, really? I really believed that UFOs were coming to Earth.

Nue:
Such a mind would naturally see a UFO.
Some people see pieces of wood, some see birds or monsters. There may even be people who saw them as danmaku.

Marisa:
So why did you do that?

Nue:
I wanted to mess with Murasa's efforts. I thought I'd confuse them and make them fail.
But when you came into the picture, all the pieces of the silo were assembled.
I ended up just getting you interested instead. That's why I helped you out, too.

Marisa:
You helped me out?

Nue:
Well, in the end, it just ended up with you beating me like this.
Now, human! Boil me! Bake me alive! Do anything you wish!
Oh, but please, just don't seal me underground again.

Marisa:
Boil you? Bake you? Bleh, I'm not gonna eat you.
Well, that was fun, but I guess I should be going soon.
But, in return, will you let me have some of those Seeds of Unknown Form or whatever?

Nue:
Huh? Well, I suppose...

Marisa:
Yes! Wait, it's not a snake? It's a glowing orb, huh?
I was sure this seed was a snake when it was inside the UFO.

Nue:
Don't worry, it's the same thing.
It's changed shapes for you now that you know it's the Seed of Unknown Form.

Marisa:
Huh. That's really interesting.
Maybe I'll keep the reality behind the UFOs a secret from Reimu for now.
I think I can have some fun playing with this Seed of Unknown Form for a while.

Kogasa:
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

Marisa:
Where did it disappear to?
Maybe it was hopeless trying to chase something that small.
Well, there's a lot of UFOs around here. I guess I can always break open some more.
Huh? What's that weird sound......
A bird... no, some kind of monster? What is it?

???:
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting would be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Storage.

Marisa:
You... you showed up in the ship, and in Makai.
Hm, a flying youkai of unknown nature... Do I know of any youkai like that?
I guess that'd make you something like a nue?

Nue:
Correct.
Still, even if you went all the way to Makai to save that monk,
I'm surprised you'd break open one of those imaginary UFOs and come chasing after me.

Marisa:
Oh, ohhh?
You're really a nue?

Nue:
You're an interesting human.
You're not afraid of things you don't understand?

Marisa:
Afraid?
I'd be excited to find something I didn't know anything about.

Nue:
Hmm. It must be nice to be young.

Marisa:
Hehe, I guess.

Nue:
This must be an unintended consequence of my scattering the Seed of Unknown Form around.

Marisa:
Seed of Unknown Form?

Nue:
I thought I'd scatter the fragments of the Flying Storage around and use them to scare you humans, but...

Marisa:
Oh, the UFO? Is that what you meant by that seed?

Nue:
The only people who thought it looked like a UFO was a few of you humans.
It was just something flying through the sky, something you didn't recognize.
Each person sees it differently depending on their experience and knowledge.

Marisa:
Huh.
I don't really get it, but...

Nue:
So, why did you come looking for me? Why were you chasing after the UFO?

Marisa:
Oh, just curiosity. Curiosity about the unknown.

Nue:
Then what will happen to my reason to live?

Nue:
I'm the nue, the youkai of indeterminate form. Being unknown is the source of my power.

Marisa:
Hm, you wanna go?
I don't get what's going on, but I don't wanna lose to someone nue-like.

Nue:
You youngster acting out of curiosity! This unidentified flying object will make you dance to your death!

Nue:
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl, even if I've been asleep for so long......

Marisa:
Hey, I won.
I still don't know what's going on, but what did you do?

Nue:
I've... been locked away underground for a long, long time.

Marisa:
You must've done something bad.

Nue:
We were all freed somehow at the beginning of this year. The underground itself was, really.
When that happened, I noticed Murasa and the others sealed away with me were up to something.
They said that if the Flying Storage were freed, too, they might be able to bring back Hijiri.

Marisa:
She's already back now.

Nue:
I wasn't part of their group, so I felt like I just couldn't let them have their fun.
So, I scattered the Flying Storage's fragments above ground.
I made them into unidentified flying objects.

Marisa:
And that's what looked like UFOs.

Nue:
Well, that's enough talk. Are you going to seal me away, too?

Marisa:
Seal you?

Nue:
A long time ago, when a human discovered my true form, they immediately captured me and sealed me away underground.

Marisa:
Oh, I don't wanna do anything like that.
I guess there's people who love sealing stuff up, though.
I don't know why you don't seem to get along with any of Byakuren's crowd, though.

Nue:
Hmm? Oh, no, Murasa and them were good company.
I just wish they would admit they're siding with the humans. That gets on my nerves.

Marisa:
Siding with humans? You mean, because they're siding with Byakuren?

Nue:
I thought I'd give in, though, since Murasa and the others were shut in underground for a long time, too.

Marisa:
I'm pretty sure you've got the wrong idea.
See, that Byakuren monk is a total sham.
She fought humans, and even said that youkai need saving more than humans do.
And on top of all that, they put up a temple specifically for use by youkai.

Nue:
What? That monk is? Are you sure?

Marisa:
It wouldn't be a surprise for them to be interested in helping a youkai like you.

Nue:
What's that...? I can't believe I caused trouble for a human like that.

Marisa:
Oh, I think it'll be fine if you just go meet her. They're pretty close to the human village.

Nue:
No, I can't go see them.
If I meet Murasa, they'll find out I'm the one that was causing them trouble. Besides,
My real body is hurt now.

Marisa:
Huh. Well, anyway, I think I've got some rumors to go spread now.
All about the true form of the nue.

Nue:
Aahhn...

Kogasa:
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

Sanae:
Hmmm, it was a bird until just now, but now it's a flying monster......
What on earth is this creature, anyway?
It was riding in a UFO, so I think it's got to be some kind of alien, but...
...... I can hear something......
It sounds like a bird, or a monster, or a baby...... Or a screaming voice, or laughter...

???:
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought a human specializing in youkai hunting would be the one to find the fragments of the Flying Storage.

Sanae:
Oh, I found the mysterious shining thing!
You're the alien that was riding in the UFO, right!?

Nue:
Sorry, but...

Nue:
I'm a nue, the youkai best known as being mysterious.

Sanae:
Oh? Hm, you're speaking Japanese, too.

Nue:
Yes, because I'm not an alien.
But, what are you saying? Are aliens scarier than I am?

Sanae:
Who are you?

Nue:
Look, I told you, I'm a nue.

Sanae:
Nue......? I think I've heard that word before...

Nue:
What? I know I used to be famous.

Sanae:
Well, if you're not an alien, I guess I'll just have to beat you. Wait, so what was the UFO, then?

Nue:
The UFO was an impression born from your own experience.

Sanae:
Huh? But, I saw lots of them.
It was definitely a flying saucer. The old-fashioned kind.

Nue:
Your heart is what's old-fashioned.
But why wouldn't an old-fashioned person know about me? That's too bad...

Sanae:
Well, whatever. If you're a youkai, I have to beat you!

Nue:
I'm glad you don't know my true nature.
But, if you're not afraid, my heart will dry up.

Sanae:
I won't be surprised by any more youkai!

Nue:
So, you human who's forgotten the fear of youkai! Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

Nue:
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl, even if I've been asleep for so long......

Sanae:
I told you, I won't lose to any more youkai!

Nue:
I see I've lost my touch. Are the humans above ground no longer afraid of the night?
Oh well, do whatever horrible thing you please.

Sanae:
Well, it's not like I fought you because I wanted to do something horrible to you.
What was that UFO, anyway? Why didn't it look like a UFO to Byakuren?
I just wanted to get the answer to those questions.

Nue:
Well, I'm a youkai whose true form is unknown.
I put the Seed of Unknown Form on the fragments of the Flying Storage.
That seed has the power to change form into whatever is in the head of the person looking at it.
Since you thought something unknown floating in the sky had to be a UFO, you saw a UFO.
To people who knew of the Flying Storage, they saw its fragments.

Sanae:
So, the UFO was really only in my head? Why did you do that, then?

Nue:
Well, I thought it would get in Murasa's way, and it would make the humans scared.
But it looks like you weren't scared at all.
And on top of that, it looks like it made you help out Murasa's group.

Sanae:
Well, humans love UFOs, you know?
There's no way we'd be scared of them.

Nue:
So humans aren't afraid of unidentified flying objects these days?

Sanae:
That's right, this is an age where an old flying umbrella won't scare people.

Nue:
Oh well, in that case maybe it would be scarier if I just went on a rampage in my true form.

Sanae:
Ah, but then I'll have to exterminate you for real.

Kogasa:
Booo!
I messed up last time.
You have to wait until night to surprise humans!

Sanae:
Hmmm, it looked like a bird before, but now it's a monster flying through the sky...
What the heck is this thing?
Since it's riding in a UFO, I think it's got to be an alien, but...
...... I can hear something......
A voice, but I can't understand it...... Maybe it's an alien's voice?

???:
Congratulations on rescuing Hijiri!
I never thought the fragments of the Flying Storage would be found by a human specializing in youkai hunting.

Sanae:
Oh, I found the mysterious shining thing!
Is this really an alien encounter?

Nue:
What's an alien?

Sanae:
Oh, wow, that was Japanese. I guess all aliens are bilingual these days.
Well, alien really just means someone from an unknown, far-off land.
But, usually it refers to space creatures. Other humans just aren't that unusual anymore.

Nue:
Hmm, so aliens are something unidentified, right?

Sanae:
No, not really, I mean, they've already classified a bunch of different kinds of aliens.
Like the Little Greys, the Oranges, Venusians... They're pretty well known.

Nue:
Then, I suppose humans aren't afraid of aliens, either.

Sanae:
That's right, we'd like to meet them. That's why I hope SETI is a success!

Nue:
SETI?

Sanae:
So, who are you?

Nue:
I'm a nue, the youkai best known as being mysterious.
I can scare people because they don't know my true form.

Sanae:
Nue...hm, I think I've heard of that before. Maybe.
Oh, yeah, I think they show up a lot as monsters in games, or something.
Let's see...head of a tiger, legs of a snake......?

Nue:
Snakes don't have any legs.

Sanae:
I wonder if I should just think of you as an alien?

Nue:
Hm, well, if it's easier that way I suppose it's not a problem.

Sanae:
Yes! Now I can tell people I met an alien.

Nue:
You're not afraid?

Sanae:
Now, I'll go bring the tengu, so shall we take a picture together to commemorate the occasion?

Nue:
Yes, it looks like you're not going to be afraid.
But if you're not afraid, my heart will go dry.

Sanae:
Come on, let's get all dressed up.

Nue:
Now, you human who adores the strange! Die from the terror of this unidentified flying object!!

Nue:
I-I can't believe I've been beaten by such a young girl, even if I've been asleep for so long......

Sanae:
I knew it, you came to Gensokyo riding on that UFO, didn't you?

Nue:
W-well, indeed, I-

Sanae:
What planet did you come from? You must have a really advanced civilization, right?

Nue:
Er, well, I suppose.

Sanae:
You're so amazing.

Nue:
An alien is?

Sanae:
Yes, well, it's been 40 years since humans landed on the moon, and we haven't even made it to Mars yet.
Everyone said the 21st century would be the age of space flight, but...
All they're worrying about outside is saving the environment and figuring out how to keep the economy afloat.
It's just crazy. The world's full of people who don't even think about why they're here.

Nue:
Huh...

Sanae:
Compared to that, Gensokyo is a dream land.

Nue:
Even if youkai like me want to eat humans?

Sanae:
See, that's exactly it!
Something eccentric like that could only happen here.
You could only meet an alien here in Gensokyo, so, why don't we take that picture now?
Please come with me!

Nue:
(She still thinks I'm an alien...) W-well, okay.

Sanae:
Hurry up, or I'll leave you behind„Éº!

Cirno:
That thing just now...
It had to be that legendary giant youkai, Daidarabotchi!
If I can tame it, I'm not gonna be scared of anything ever again!

Sanae:
It seems that it was here before it disappeared.

Cirno:
Oh? As soon as I thought the big thing disappeared, now this small thing has appeared.

Sanae:
Hey, over there, Miss Fairy. In this vicinity, have you seen a giant ro... I mean... I wonder if you've seen a huge moving human shape around here?

Cirno:
I haven't seen a Daidarabotchi.

Sanae:
Daidarabotchi? I wonder, did I really say anything like that...?

Cirno:
Ah, no, never mind. I haven't seen anything at all!

Sanae:
I wonder if you could be plotting something? Playing the brocken spectre in this deep fog?

Cirno:
Brocken spectre? What's that?

Sanae:
An illusion that looks like a giant stretched-out moving youkai. Speaking of which, you saw such a huge human shape, right?

Cirno:
I saw it, I saw it. I saw it over there.

Meiling:
That giant just now... I wonder what it was.
Just when I thought it had lurched its way to the mountains, it disappeared along with a lukewarm mist.
I'm sure that must have been an evil omen. The shadow of Taisui Xingjun!

Sanae:
Excuse me.

Meiling:
Wh-What is it? We never accept guests here...

Sanae:
I was wondering if you'd perhaps seen a huge human-like figure around here?

Meiling:
If you're talking about a huge human-like figure, then I saw one head towards the mountain...

Sanae:
Towards the mountain...? I just came from the mountain. I wonder if I passed it at some point...

Meiling:
So, who do you think you are, just coming in as you please?

Sanae:
Huh? Is this a place where I can't come in as I please?

Meiling:
Of course you can't. These are the estate grounds of a devil. I won't let an exorcist pass!

Sanae:
I really don't have any interest in this mansion. In any case, that giant robot... figure can't exactly hide.

Meiling:
Eh? A giant robot?

Sanae:
What's this lukewarm mist?
The base of the mountain! It appeared! The giant human-like figure!

Sanae:
The Underground Geyser Center. This was created for Lady Kanako's plans, and is where all the technological breakthroughs for the mountain happen.
It's certainly possible with a place like this! This must be the giant robot's docking bay!
In the outside world, giant robots don't exist outside of anime, but since this is Gensokyo, then maybe...!
In Gensokyo, where the fairies dance and the tengu whirl about, surely...!

Reimu:
What's with this lousy pitfall trap!? Huh? What the heck is this place?

Sanae:
Reimu. What happened?

Reimu:
I thought I'd go to the hot spring, when all of a sudden, the ground crumbled...

Sanae:
My goodness. I wonder if I forgot to take care of the cover-hatch.

Reimu:
Where is this?

Sanae:
This is the Underground Geyser Center. A facility used for researching nuclear fusion.

Reimu:
You're planning something naughty again, aren't you!?

Sanae:
I would never think of doing anything naughty.

Reimu:
Talk is cheap! Making such a huge pitfall trap is unforgivable!

Sanae:
I'm not the one responsible for these circumstances, nor am I the one in control of them.

Reimu:
Owie. Now I'm starting to feel the pain from the fall.

Sanae:
This is where the kappa come to research and build. I was... interested in something, so I came here, but...

Reimu:
Oh, is that right? Well, whatever.
If anything weird happens, it'll just be your fault.

Sanae:
Now then. I'll be arriving at the deepest level soon.

Sanae:
It's so hot...
Staying here too long could be dangerous at such high temperatures.

Utsuho:
Foreign substance sighted!
Upon contamination within the nuclear reactor core, reactor operations are to be halted and the foreign substance eradicated immediately!

Sanae:
!

Sanae:
Wait, wait!
I'm a shrine maiden of Lady Kanako!

Utsuho:
Um. Who's Lady Kanako?

Sanae:
Crows are really birdbrained after all. Simply put, I serve a higher power than yourself.

Utsuho:
A servant of a higher power?
A servant can't be that great, can it? Then a human that's not great is...
Ah, which reminds me, I had come because of the notification that a foreign substance had contaminated the reactor core!

Sanae:
No, I mean...

Utsuho:
And... foreign substance detected! Must eradicate that higher power's lowly foreign substance!

Sanae:
Unless I can completely exhaust that lively energy of yours, it looks like we won't be able to talk any further.

Sanae:
That's as far as you go!

Utsuho:
Wait, what were we doing again?

Sanae:
Er... You were listening to my orders and helping me with my investigation of this reactor.

Utsuho:
Ah, is that right?

Sanae:
Yes, that's right. Please proceed as planned.

Utsuho:
Then what should I be doing?

Sanae:
Investigate whether or not a gigantic thing has been hiding here.

Utsuho:
What's the gigantic thing? About how gigantic?

Sanae:
It's humanoid... and about 100 meters?

Utsuho:
100 meters?

Sanae:
Hm. About the length of this reactor's diameter from end to end?

Utsuho:
A human that big!? There's no possibility of such a thing existing, right?
If there were something like that, there's no way I wouldn't have noticed.

Sanae:
I suppose that's true.
But there's no doubt that it disappeared from the surface.

Sanae:
This is certainly no particular place to seek refuge.
This reactor core is far simpler than I thought it would be. It is only hot...
We're really far underground. But even here, you can see the sky.
The sky appears so tiny from here that you can barely sense its presence.
I wonder if it would have been better if the vampires lived here.
In any case, the reactor core is blazing hot. It seems the rising vapors originated here.
Aha! Perhaps that figure I saw earlier...!
Was it just the vapors rising from here projecting someone's shape...?
No, it couldn't be anything like that. It looked so much more real...
What?
That sounds like footsteps... And this vibration...
So something that was merely fantasy in the outside world has made its way into Gensokyo...

Sanae:
Yes, this is surely that thing!
That thing that is never implemented because of its impracticality!
The bipedal giant robot I've longed to see is in Gensokyo!

Suwako:
Look out belooow!

Suwako:
Oops! It seems I landed on something.
Oh my, it's Sanae. What are you doing here?

Sanae:
Owie... What in the name of...
Oh! Lady Suwako? What are you doing here!?

Suwako:
I had some small things to take care of.
Anyway, it's amazing that you're down here, Sanae.

Sanae:
Oh, yes! I've discovered something fantastic!

Suwako:
Ohhh? Tell me, tell me.

Sanae:
I came here in pursuit of a giant shadow, but...
There was actually a giant robot. Right here in Gensokyo!

Suwako:
Giant robot?

Sanae:
Yes, well, I don't have definite proof yet, but its existence is truly a wonder.

Suwako:
Well, that's surprising! So, where did you see it?

Sanae:
Just above this place. But it disappeared in a poof when I arrived.

Suwako:
Above this place? Disppeared in a poof?

Sanae:
Speaking of which, what were those small things you came to take care of, Lady Suwako?

Suwako:
Hisou Tensoku's being bad. I came underground to restart it.

Sanae:
Hisou Tensoku...??? What might that be?

Suwako:
Hisou Tensoku is... wait, what? Sanae, you say you saw a giant robot?

Sanae:
Huh? Is there some connection to the giant robot or something?

Suwako:
Ahaha! Can it be that the robot Sanae caught a glimpse of...

Sanae:
There's something you know, isn't there!?

Suwako:
Hm, maybe. If it's a "giant robot," then it's probably Hisou Tensoku, right?
Oh, that cracks me up! The phrase "giant robot" sure brings me back.

Sanae:
Well, what's wrong with calling it that? And you say this giant robot is named Hisou Tensoku?

Suwako:
I named it that 'cause it can't conceive the law of nature - Tensoku. In other words, it's an idiot.

Sanae:
Huh?

Suwako:
Sanae, you were also being an idiot for chasing after it.

Sanae:
What did you say?

Suwako:
Well, you're calling it a giant robot. Hisou Tensoku is just...
Well, a dumb blockhead...

Sanae:
Does Lady Kanako know anything about what you're calling Hisou Tensoku?

Suwako:
She doesn't, doesn't she? Maaaybe?

Sanae:
The point is, hasn't there been a lot of this lately? Doing all kinds of weird things that you want without telling anyone?

Suwako:
It's no big deal, really.

Sanae:
This isn't right! Doing this even though keeping the nuclear fusion reactor a secret in the past just made everyone angry!

Suwako:
Right, Hisou Tensoku is ...

Sanae:
Today, you won't be getting away! I'll have you regard my convictions as a human being.

Suwako:
But Sanaeee, you're a living god, a god that is not human,...

Sanae:
All the better, then. I can stand equally with you.
Lady Suwako, you've simply gone too far with your selfish deeds! Now and here, I'll have you endure a bit of pain.

Suwako:
Uhyaa! Excellent, it's a battle, then! This should be fun...

Sanae:
I won't hold back, okay?

Suwako:
Since you dare to battle here in the underground where I hold a natural advantage, you've grown up a little too, haven't you, Sanae?
If you beat me here, maybe we won't have to worry about always helping you with your trouble-solving trips anymore.

Sanae:
Ah, but I travelled alone today.

Suwako:
I felt that Kanako was getting worried. Thinking "Would she know the way back home?" and such.
Well, then! Awe me, creator of these lands, with your marvelous, god-like miracles!

Cirno:
That thing just now...
It had to be that legendary giant youkai Daidarabotchi! If I can tame it, I'm not gonna be scared of anything ever again!

Sanae:
It seems that it was somewhere around here when it disappeared.

Cirno:
Oh? As soon as I thought the big thing disappeared, now this small thing has appeared.

Sanae:
Hey, over there, Miss Fairy. In this vicinity, have you seen a giant ro... I mean... I wonder if you've seen a huge moving human shape around here?

Cirno:
I haven't seen anything like a Daidarabotchi!

Sanae:
Daidarabotchi? I wonder, did I really say anything like that...?

Cirno:
Ah, no, never mind. I haven't seen anything at all!

Sanae:
I wonder if you could be plotting something? Playing the Brocken spectre in this deep fog?

Cirno:
Hmm. I'm feeling great today!
Now then, how about I go searching for the Daidarabotchi!?

Sanae:
Owie. Ow. I guess I shouldn't have taken her too lightly just because she was a fairy.

Meiling:
If that was the Taisui Xingjun, then this could be bad.
Pretty soon we'll be visited by a catastrophe!

Cirno:
What are you grumbling to yourself?

Meiling:
Wh-what is it? Oh, it's just a fairy.

Cirno:
Yep, a fairy. But I'm just passing by so...

Meiling:
Okay. I have a very important task that I must take care of.
So, just finish passing by and go away.

Cirno:
Weren't you getting all hot and bothered over something just now? I'm kind of interested.

Meiling:
!? It's nothing for a fairy to worry about!

Cirno:
This may be more interesting than the Daidarabotchi!

Meiling:
I've no choice then... looks like I'll have to chase the pest away first.

Cirno:
Ermmmmm, what was I going to do?

Meiling:
Eh?

Cirno:
Err, umm. Hey, lady, do you know what I was going to do?

Meiling:
Eh? Ah, I know! You said Daidarabotchi or something.

Cirno:
Oh yeah! Searching for the Daidarabotchi! Gotta go!

Meiling:
....

Marisa:
The hot spring here sure does wonders for the body.
Now if there was only some well-chilled sake around then that'd be the best...

Cirno:
Was it over here?

Marisa:
Oh, a well-chilled fairy. Seeing one in a place like this is rare.

Cirno:
Have you seen a Daidarabotchi around here?

Marisa:
A Daidarabotchi?

Cirno:
A gigantically huge youkai! I saw it around here somewhere just now!

Marisa:
Ho ho! A big youkai, is it? Hm, I can't say I don't know.

Cirno:
Eh? Really? Where, where?

Marisa:
Not telling. I've no obligation to tell a fairy.

Cirno:
So then it'll be OK if I hurt you and force you spit it all out?

Cirno:
C'mon! Where is it!

Marisa:
Owie. Ow. I'll talk already, so just hold up a sec.
That thing... went into this here Geyser Underground Center.

Cirno:
Really!? Then I'll find it real soon right?
I'll be the first one there!

Marisa:
Well then, that was a total lie.
It's gonna be too hot for her in there. Serves her right.
But what was that about a Daidarabotchi...? Hey, what's that? In the forest...

Cirno:
So hot! This is unbearable!

Utsuho:
Foreign substance detected! Significant drop in reactor core temperatures requires urgent attention. The foreign substance is to be immediately eradicated!

Cirno:
Wawawawawa!

Cirno:
This is hot! I've got to get the heck out of here!

Utsuho:
Do you think I'll let you escape before I eradicate you!?

Cirno:
I'll escape before I get eradicated!

Utsuho:
Will you really manage to escape from me? Or will I simply force you to buzz off?
It's a fight!

Cirno:
Now's my chance! I'm outta here!

Utsuho:
Now then, you can't possibly escape from my next attack!
Eh, what? Could it be... I've raised the firepower so much that she got vaporized without a trace?
I've overdone it a bit. Well, whatever. Let's get back to work.

Marisa:
Oh, you certainly returned quickly.

Cirno:
It was unbelievable! This place!

Marisa:
I guess so. This is the hot spring's boiler after all.

Cirno:
If the Daidarabotchi is in that kinda place then I can't do anything but give up....

Marisa:
Come on, wait a second. Don't get so depressed like that.

Cirno:
?

Marisa:
I saw a big youkai in the forest's direction just now. It seems like it moved itself over there unnoticed.

Cirno:
Really!?

Marisa:
Yeah, this time I'm not lying. It's over there. Look! See it?

Cirno:
Oh wow! Something big's there!

Marisa:
That thing... I wonder what it could be. Somehow, I can sort of imagine.

Alice:
Further research is still necessary.

Cirno:
It's here somewhere.
Noa!

Alice:
Oh, an unusual face. A lost child?

Cirno:
N-no, I'm not lost. Anyways, around here...

Alice:
Around here?

Cirno:
Didn't you see a Daidarabotchi?

Alice:
A Daidarabotchi?

Cirno:
A gigantically huge youkai! It was here just now!

Alice:
A big youkai.... Ah, I see.

Cirno:
You've seen it? You know where it is?

Alice:
I do know. Probably. You want to see it too?

Cirno:
I wanna, I wanna! I've been looking for it all day!

Alice:
It's still in an experimental phase but... but this might be just the right time for a test run.

Cirno:
Hurry! Hurry! Daidaarabotchi!

Alice:
To replenish the magic, a little energy is necessary. Your lively personality. Let's take a bit of that!

Meiling:
Lady Patchouli!

Patchouli:
What? So loud...

Meiling:
It's terrible! Just now, I saw something that should not be seen!

Patchouli:
Something that should not be seen?

Meiling:
It was the Taisui Xingjun. We must assume the worst possible scenario! [Translators' Note: Taisui Xingjun - Chinese god of disasters]

Patchouli:
... so?

Meiling:
Like, an earthquake or something like that!

Patchouli:
... Earthquakes are getting old now.

Meiling:
Huh?

Patchouli:
Whatever you're doing, it's interrupting my research. Get back to your guard post!

Meiling:
It's true.

Patchouli:
I don't care if it's true. It's just an earthquake, right?

Meiling:
How can you say "just"? We mustn't make light of earthquakes.

Meiling:
Now that it's come to this, I have no choice but to ambush it!
The Taisui Xingjun will surely send all kinds of disaster-causing youkai!

Alice:
I'd like to go to the library, could you lead me there?

Meiling:
Whoa! It's appeared already!

Alice:
What are you talking about? I just want to go to the library.

Meiling:
Heh heh heh. I'm completely aware of what's going on. You are...
You are a youkai sent by the Taisui Xingjun!

Alice:
Ahaha! As expected of the Scarlet Devil Mansion's gatekeeper!
This temporary appearance, you saw through it immediately!

Meiling:
That was dangerous. Getting attacked by familiar forms is terrifying!

Alice:
....

Meiling:
Of course you'd remain silent. It looks like you can't even move anymore.
But, I don't think it'll end with this. I have to keep up the attack!

Marisa:
Now then, today I'll be going to the library again„Éº
I'm a young lady of literature.

Meiling:
....

Marisa:
Oh?! For some reason I'm not being stopped. I'm seriously going in? I'm really going in, okay?

Meiling:
You, too, are a fake! I can see through everything!

Marisa:
A fake?

Meiling:
For you, who always comes through the main gate proudly and boldly, Coming in from the sky is ridiculous!

Marisa:
Heh heh. Very impressive. As expected of the Great Wall of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, Meiling.

Meiling:
Just about anyone could see through that disguise.

Marisa:
However, simply seeing through to my true form won't be enough to win against me!

Meiling:
Hmph. Your power wasn't that different from the original human.

Marisa:
....

Meiling:
What a fiendishly evil youkai, the Taisui Xingjun.
If it wasn't for me, The Scarlet Devil Mansion would've surely been taken over right about now...

Reimu:
Well then, today's another good day for exterminating some youkai. I'll disinfect all of the devils at the Scarlet Devil Mansion„Éº

Meiling:
Hmph. So you came! You monster of disasters.

Reimu:
Did you say monster?

Meiling:
No matter how skillfully you disguise yourself as a human, it's futile! My eyes wouldn't be deceived.

Reimu:
Hoho. When I've taken this form of a shrine maiden, you would call me a monster?
Isn't that an amusing thing to say. Even though you're the monster.

Meiling:
Hmph. Certainly I am a youkai. However...

Reimu:
However?

Meiling:
I am a youkai who loves Gensokyo with all her heart! I have nothing to do with creatures of destruction like you!

Reimu:
Splendid! Simply splendid! You're an example of youkai.
However, do you think that pretty words alone can protect peace and harmony?
We shall bring disaster into Gensokyo!
A calamity that will make the Earth itself tremble!

Meiling:
You are a little strong, but your power is still no match for mine!

Reimu:
Mmph. As expected from you, eh?
But it appears as if you've spent all your energy in a wanton series of battles.

Meiling:
Tch!

Reimu:
Now then, the time has come hasn't it, to show you my true form!

Meiling:
Finally, it seems to be revealing its true form...!

Meiling:
Where are you!? Where could you be I said!?
You who tramples Gensokyo, Taisui Xingjun's servant. It'd be good if you showed up!

Catfish:
Ahahaha. Finally, I've been revived, haven't I?
The battles with the assassins I sent to handle you, you enjoyed them didn't you?

Meiling:
?

Catfish:
I only sent those fools to drain your energy.

Meiling:
!?

Catfish:
That's right, the energy needed for my revival. For the sake of these powers that will cause the Earth itself to tremble!

Meiling:
What did you say?!

Catfish:
Without you noticing, they all worked hard for my sake.
How does it feel? Are you so furious you can't even think?
Or perhaps, Have you been struck speechless with grief?

Meiling:
Heh heh heh.

Catfish:
Why are you laughing?

Meiling:
To think that you would go that far for the sake of preparing for me.

Catfish:
What did you say?!

Meiling:
For the sake of creating my legend.

Catfish:
Eh?

Meiling:
The one that this world couldn't do without.
For the sake of the tale of the sole gatekeeper and protector of Gensokyo!

Catfish:
It's strange that you're underestimating me.
I am one who manifests the presence of the most unholy and cataclysmic of all youkai, Taisui Xingjun.
I am the legendary Supreme Catfish. I need but move and the earth itself will tremble, the lands on the surface will disintegrate.
The likes of you cannot even begin to comprehend my power!

Reimu:
Who're you?

Reimu:
Sure is hot and boring. Wanna go to the kappa's place afterwards?

Reimu:
It's hot whether I move or not. Wonder what I should do at a time like this?

Reimu:
Speaking of which, that unidentified flying youkai
got converted to Buddhism and is now living at the temple.
I guess the normal youkai really hate the underground.

Reimu:
It bothers me that the Scarlet Devil Mansion is always cool. Is there a secret to that?

Reimu:
Tonight is a summer party at the mansion! Can't get enough of those in the summer.

Reimu:
Thought of holding services for dolls? You know, there are lots of things possessing the stuff that's been made into human form.

Reimu:
I've heard lots about hair-growing dolls.
Are those controlled by strings as well? Hair by hair.

Reimu:
It's so hot, I've thought about not moving at all....

Reimu:
It's so hot.... Mind lending me a phantom or two?

Reimu:
Would you mind cutting the grass over there?

Reimu:
Next time, you should come have a test of courage at my place. You'll be frightened by the monsters there.

Reimu:
I've heard that bats aren't birds but actually mammals!

Reimu:
Usually phantoms collect easily in dark and damp places.

Reimu:
I'm feeling a bit bored, but....

Reimu:
Don't you think it's peaceful lately?
Feels like the calm before the storm.

Reimu:
I don't know any decent people who like to live underground.

Reimu:
Tonight is rabbit stew!

Reimu:
There seem to be trees called eye drop trees up on the mountain. If your eyes get so horribly red, why don't you try finding them?

Reimu:
Why do you show up in the newspaper photos?

Reimu:
Why do you show up in the newspaper photos?
Can it be that you moved at ultra high speeds after you pressed the shutter?
...and so you managed to photograph yourself?

Reimu:
The evening showers have been bad lately. Do aggressive actions of ones and you cause lightning strikes?

Reimu:
Heaven seems hot. There's nothing to shade from the sun.

Reimu:
Heaven seems hot. There's nothing to shade from the sun.
Ah, but the higher you climb the colder it gets.
Would heaven above the mountain be hot? Or would it be cold?

Reimu:
Let's see whose color is more suitable as a shrine maiden! It's a contest of the clothes!

Reimu:
Even if you get enough people to open a branch shrine,
everyone needs to donate. Profit is an indication of faith,
so you want more situations where you can exterminate youkai. I guess I need to get some more people too...

Reimu:
How stupid. There's no way you can win against me.

Reimu:
Isn't Tai chi chuan just a form of exercise?

Reimu:
I still don't understand this nuclear fusion. Why does it become hot after fusion?

Reimu:
Why does a crow live in the sun?

Reimu:
Frogs hibernating to live sure is precarious.

Reimu:
This year's summer sure is peaceful. It's good to be bored, probably.

Reimu:
Something usually happens during the summer, though.

Marisa:
Peace-senile is scary. Everyone's like they're fighting for no reason.

Marisa:
Oh yeah, I've found something dug up at the bazaar.
That Seed of Unknown Form.
Maybe you can still find them lying around Gensokyo.

Marisa:
You're going to the bazaar? You're too late, almost all the good stuff's gone.

Marisa:
This sunshine is even making it hot in the forest this year.

Marisa:
Won't they explode if you leave them out for too long in this heat? Those dolls, that is.

Marisa:
You've got waterproof books as well. I bet you could even read those in the bath.

Marisa:
Speaking of which, I wrote a book too!
It's bad of me to keep borrowing books, so I'll put my book here at the library this time!
How much will you pay for it?

Marisa:
Though there are seasons in the Netherworld, there aren't any in Higan, huh.

Marisa:
Sorry I always come during the day. I'm asleep at night.

Marisa:
Graveyards were the meccas of summer, yeah. But... what's a mecca?

Marisa:
How many eels should you eat in the midsummer day? If it's a lamprey eel, one should be enough, I bet.

Marisa:
However, who decides when midsummer is anyway?

Marisa:
A cloud is a gathering of things, isn't it? Why don't you ever ride one or something?

Marisa:
Gather the ones who have free time for me tonight. When it gets cool after sundown, we'll have a party!

Marisa:
Harvesting bamboo is a lot tougher than I thought it would be. It's about as hard as it is to eat.

Marisa:
I saw that fast-growin' bamboo.
When you run, it's easy to run into them.
Your traps are more dangerous than a cat's.

Marisa:
I've got a good idea for you. Why don't you try putting a weather forecast in the newspaper? Wouldn't that sell?

Marisa:
With newspapers, you collect the stories yourself so no one else has to go anywhere.
That's convenient, but everyone reading the same thing is boring.
I could beat you at your own game by just walking around myself. Maybe you should try to write a paper like that too, you know?

Marisa:
How about have the kappa make you a motorboat? It'd make your job fun.

Marisa:
Does your boat sink easily?
No, it's just that I heard that the boats that phantoms ride on sink easily.
Maybe it's not for all phantoms, just a certain one?

Marisa:
So you're really starting to get the hang of youkai extermination, huh?

Marisa:
If you do nothing but youkai hunting, you might become close to one yourself.

Marisa:
Ah, my bad. I actually haven't seen a Daidarabotchi.

Marisa:
What's it to you if you beat me? I'm not letting you catch up to my skill level.

Marisa:
No, it's just that. It's so hot today. So hot, I could die.

Marisa:
Will you spare me some of that sometime? That nuclear energy.

Marisa:
When nothing happens, everyone stays the same. It's such a boring situation.

Marisa:
It's scary just whether I can win before I have a rush rain in the evening.

Sakuya:
The shrine really got fixed back to the way it was before. Even though that was a chance to renovate....

Sakuya:
The mushrooms that look strange taste delicious. Appearance is very important to flavor.

Sakuya:
Since I've won, tonight's dinner will be Japanese-style.

Sakuya:
Since I've won... we'll have rice with forest mushrooms tonight.

Sakuya:
The weather's fine today, it's great whether you go out or not.

Sakuya:
What was the stone you got at the bazaar today?
It just looks like an ordinary stone that fell on the dry river bed to me.

Sakuya:
Have you perhaps noticed anything strange at all lately?

Sakuya:
You're up early lately.
Much preparations need to be done in the afternoon, 
so it's better if you'd graciously rest.

Sakuya:
You're eating even though you're dead. That must really mess up the food chain.

Sakuya:
What happens to the dead if they starve themselves to death?
I don't think they'd come back to life. Perhaps they just become a hungry ghost.

Sakuya:
Have you been up to something lately? That usually means that things are about to get noisy...

Sakuya:
Ah, perfect timing... Could I borrow some sake from you?

Sakuya:
That gourd of limitless sake.
I think it's valuable for purposes other than drinking.
Why don't we compete with that nuclear energy with alcoholic fuel?

Sakuya:
Newsprint is very convenient to have. It wipes windows clean...

Sakuya:
Where do you do that movable type printing? That mountain isn't that big anyway.

Sakuya:
If your boat were in the form of a swan, don't you think the River would look so much nicer?

Sakuya:
There are fish I've never seen before living in the Sanzu River. That's right, I should go fishing next time.

Sakuya:
Maybe I should make eel for tonight's dinner... Or maybe I shouldn't. I wonder what made me think that.

Sakuya:
Whenever I find an oarfish I usually find it looking dead. I even thought they're actually fish from the Sanzu River.

Sakuya:
A peach isn't particularly suited to be anything but dessert... I actually think a ham would be much more appropriate.

Sakuya:
Heaven's cuisine really isn't that bad. It's only because your tastes became more refined.

Sakuya:
How is it? Life in Gensokyo never gets tiring, right?

Sakuya:
And I thought you might be a better shrine maiden than Reimu. Seems like that's not the case.

Sakuya:
You're the one who messed up our garden, isn't it?

Sakuya:
No matter how many times a fairy is defeated, it won't die.
That's why they charge in so recklessly.
I found their thoughtlessness and bravery strange, but now that I've seen you fight, I'm sure I understand.

Sakuya:
You can't be a gatekeeper if you're that weak, you know?

Sakuya:
Come now, get back to work.

Sakuya:
You're using such high energies just for fireballs. That's such a waste.

Sakuya:
Frogs....taste like chicken. But I think chickens are easier to catch.

Sakuya:
It seemed so peaceful lately, but there are a lot of people acting behind-the-scenes.

Sakuya:
To deal with thieves, we planted mandrakes in the garden at regular intervals.

Alice:
Soon, the ultimate doll should be complete. With this, the forest will be mine.

Alice:
It seems that it's more convenient to control the dolls myself than have dolls that think on their own.

Alice:
Moving seems like it'd be such a hassle. Way too many books.

Alice:
You want me to make you something? A tough, square doll?

Alice:
Every time a service was held for a doll, it gets dropped into Gensokyo, I see.

Alice:
Pretty soon, I'll cut you down to size. You have no exclusive patent on enlargement!

Alice:
You're very different from Reimu. Yes, shrine maidens and gods are to be a pair.

Alice:
Even if you were stuffed inside a doll, I don't think anyone would notice...

Alice:
Aren't there about ten thousand soldier dolls buried under your country? Amazing.

Alice:
I don't really associate crows with the sun.

Alice:
Stuffed frogs are very popular among the humans of the village. But tadpoles are quite nice.

Alice:
Thinking of nothing but researching the new fighting techniques, everyone's so starved for battle.

Alice:
Nothing is better than strength in numbers. Big things are a combination of small things!

Patchouli:
The shrine isn't a good place for using magic. It needs to be more chaotic.

Patchouli:
The essence of magic is to determine the root cause of all things. There's no distinction between science and magic.

Patchouli:
Recently, that rat has been doing more damage again.

Patchouli:
Though you're using magical strings to control the dolls, controlling so many is quite a feat.

Patchouli:
However, image-splitting is tiring...

Patchouli:
Explaining the existence of phantoms using magic is a good first step in studying it.

Patchouli:
You want to go see the kappa's place again? But it's so close to the river.

Patchouli:
When humans die they become able to use magic. That is the same as giving up humanity.

Patchouli:
The magic outside sure has advanced. There are too few researchers in Gensokyo.

Patchouli:
After that, there's been various things that spurt out from the underworld, it seems.
There was something that came out in early spring. 
Did you notice?

Patchouli:
The eyes of the holly olive leaves are stuck? What a ridiculous line.

Patchouli:
My eyes must be getting worse or something.

Patchouli:
If you want to sort them, tengu are the magician types. They're the same in seeking the truth.

Patchouli:
The Higan has no day or night, no winter or summer. I wonder what that means.

Patchouli:
Swimming through the clouds sure is convenient. I wonder if you ever meet dragons.

Patchouli:
Heaven has no weather? So you mean, weather is something that was conjured?

Patchouli:
Curses base themselves on imitating form.
From the starting line, they are different from the magic which expose the truth. 
But I guess in the end they are the same thing.

Patchouli:
Fairies are things of natural phenomenon. And there are often instances of magic controlling fairies. Hence they are slaves.

Patchouli:
So? Are you properly doing your job?

Patchouli:
Reading manga all the time makes you sleepy. That's because you don't use your head.
When you're sleepy, is it because you are not thinking, or is it that it doesn't require thinking at all?
If you use your head, then you won't become sleepy.

Patchouli:
So, how does nuclear fusion work? I wonder how it creates energy.

Patchouli:
The powers that gods use are basically curses, huh?

Patchouli:
The power of magic is like those of science. Meaning, it's at the forefront of the times.

Patchouli:
Ahhh, boiling water with magic today as well.

Youmu:
Maybe you say "I shall make you the rust of my sword" because of the iron in blood?

Youmu:
Japanese swords are specialized for slashing. They're much more refined than knives meant for stabbing.

Youmu:
It's possible to knock knives out of the air with a sword. You can even cut an entire barrage of them if you try hard.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko said that against agile opponents, you should shut your eyes.
Is it because you don't see the afterimages when your eyes are shut?

Youmu:
My sword can easily cut through opponents like you.

Youmu:
Lady Yuyuko, why don't you train sword techniques with me sometimes? It'll settle your spirits, you know?

Youmu:
Oh right, about the pickled vegetables I was pickling before....
Strangely enough, I leave them out for days or even years, but they don't ever change much.
And to think the food at the shrine becomes delicious after one day of pickling....

Youmu:
It seems that thing flying in the air in the early spring was apparently a treasure ship.
I didn't really understand after hearing about it from Reimu and the others,
but I'm glad it wasn't a boat that could cause us harm.

Youmu:
By the way, is it okay to keep the boundary between this world and the next ambiguous like this?

Youmu:
I heard that the blades used for slaying oni are special. Well then, I'll announce this sword is special too.

Youmu:
Won't you help the spirits of the children by the Sanzu River? I always worry about them crossing to the other side.

Youmu:
Looks to me that Heaven isn't saturated at all. If this is all there is, then the Netherworld is far more crowded.

Youmu:
You didn't fly around in early spring? I saw this big ship-like thing.

Youmu:
So there are shrines in the outside world too, huh? I thought that they were already a lost culture.

Youmu:
You can break ice if you put enough reckless power into it, so it's difficult to cut.

Youmu:
Don't you use things like the Green Dragon Blade? I hear things like that often...

Youmu:
It's fusion, but it explodes...??? I wonder what's going on there.

Youmu:
Are you the god from top of the mountain? You sure don't look like it.

Remilia:
You had a test of courage at the shrine? Why didn't you call me?

Remilia:
It seems there's a temple in the village now.
What makes it different from a shrine?

Remilia:
Ah, man. In the summer, a huge hat like that must be good for blocking sunlight.

Remilia:
So bored. Go bring me someone interesting.

Remilia:
I want to go to the bazaar, but it's on the river plain....
I want to see the Hisou Tensoku....

Remilia:
Oh, I saw a golem doll. It looked totally weak.

Remilia:
What, you don't have any manga or anything? These are the only books you have.

Remilia:
Vampires don't have reflections. So this is simply an afterimage.

Remilia:
Until now, I thought of ghosts as just zombies, but you seem different. I wonder where the mummies are?

Remilia:
Huh? White or black? Aren't bats always black?

Remilia:
You know, watermelons look more like slices of meat than grapes.

Remilia:
Writing is a pain. How do you write so neatly in newspapers?

Remilia:
I've heard that oarfish are a really rare kind of fish.

Remilia:
I've heard that oarfish are a really rare kind of fish.
Hmmm... I should let Sakuya know as soon as possible. She has a soft spot for rare ingredients.

Remilia:
Ehh, so other than peaches, you also eat pills? Do you eagerly chew on Jintan and the such?

Remilia:
Heh, so you can become a god just by making the wind blow, huh?

Remilia:
Fairies are completely useless.

Remilia:
How was that manga? Was it interesting?

Remilia:
I rather dislike the sun...

Remilia:
You seem to be in constant motion. I thought fighting you would be interesting, but...

Yuyuko:
Oh? What business do you have today?

Yuyuko:
Why is it that it's so easy to get lost in the forest? Though it's easy to get lost, you don't really get lost....

Yuyuko:
Oh, sword training? I don't care for such an unrefined kind of training, myself.

Yuyuko:
The sun always rises. Your weak point comes around once every day.

Yuyuko:
Have you realized?
A sun has risen from hell in order to bring you down.
Now, how will you react?

Yuyuko:
Ahh, I'm bored. Won't you bring something here?

Yuyuko:
Ah, the fireworks are really something this year. What a wonderful sight.

Yuyuko:
Speaking of summer activities...
It must be that game where you cover your eyes and smash something with a club.
Suika-bashing.

Yuyuko:
This year you've been moving here and there. Did something happen?

Yuyuko:
Ah, that's all I have for you this summer. Having cool things in the summer is important.

Yuyuko:
Tai chi chuan goes well with paper fans, it seems.

Yuyuko:
Ahh, one sun is enough, especially in this summer heat!

Yuyuko:
Goodness me, you are a god. Recently, I haven't been able to tell whether shrine maidens or gods are the slaves of the other...

Yuyuko:
The shrine over there... doesn't it get crowded with three gods in it?
Hakugyokurou is many times bigger than that, but it still feels cramped.
Ahh, I see. You've got no money. Shrines are like that.

Yukari:
A heart dwelling within a human-shaped object. How is that different from a youkai, I wonder?

Yukari:
The magic of the outside world is not so primitive. Now, there are even things like giant robots.

Yukari:
That bat you saw, was it white? Or was it black?

Yukari:
I'm busy lately. I'm busy like it's peacetime!

Yukari:
Oni are quite impressive, and quite popular. Have you perhaps gathered more faith than the clumsy gods?

Yukari:
Hearts dwell within human-shaped objects. And photographs are no exception.

Yukari:
The monkey who arose to the heavens rebelled from his post in rage. In the end, he was imprisoned upon the mountain.

Yukari:
How is it? Getting used to this place?

Yukari:
If you could cool off a bigger area, I don't think I'd be so annoyed at work.

Yukari:
You living in a red building, that's some kind of joke, right?

Yukari:
Solar power is already not kind to the youkai. However, your power goes too far, to the extent of evil.

Yukari:
There are many selfish ones among the gods. I wonder if they don't notice because they are the receivers of faith.

Suika:
Why was everyone gathering at the foot of the mountain? Was something there?

Suika:
Hey, how about you build a bigger doll, then show it to me, alright?

Suika:
Today's a bore too. Come to me with something interesting.

Suika:
But where's the Dragon Palace? Don't tell me it's at the bottom of the sea!

Suika:
I thought you were just a quiet shrine maiden, but that's not right at all, huh?

Suika:
I don't need riffraff as opponents.

Suika:
Powerless, huh? What if you train your body some more?

Suika:
Unbelievable! Someone like you was under Satori's home? You sure surprised me!

Suika:
If she's used to revive the Hell of Blazing Fires, then it could become a new business.
I feel that she'd do a much better job than the tengu. Though the New Hell would criticize it for being too warm.

Suika:
Anyway, you sure are something special to be able to go to the underground world whenever you want.

Reisen:
Even if you stop time, you can't escape from illusions, you know?

Reisen:
Illusions take place within the brain. In other words, an illusion will beat the speed of light!

Reisen:
The phrase "parallel world" comes from a misunderstanding. Maybe it's really the other way around.

Reisen:
They can see many kinds of small things in the outside world using things like microscopes, right?
It really seems that the act of looking itself can be a large boundary.

Reisen:
Peaches? Wow, how nostalgic.

Reisen:
Even Heaven is not at the top of everything. From the moon, it's still on the ground.

Reisen:
Mountain-climbing is such a drag. Why build a shrine at the top of the mountain?

Reisen:
When you cool things down, you take heat from the surroundings. You probably warm up inside as a result.

Reisen:
An exercise that's good for your health? Well, I think medicines are better.

Reisen:
Nuclear energy.... Such a fearsome power, I'm glad that the user is a moron.

Reisen:
No matter how many times you try to eliminate them, The native gods won't run out. That's what my master said.

Reisen:
You intended to move straight ahead but from the start, you were dizzy.

Reisen:
Well, you're an earth creature. That's why you lost.

Aya:
Hm, perhaps this shrine's blessing is the discovery of new news material?

Aya:
As always I'm able to find news at the shrine. I must pay my respects to it somehow.

Aya:
Amazing! I didn't know you were such a good juggler!

Aya:
Are you a stage magician? Next time, I want to see you cut a body in half.

Aya:
Next time, please let me interview you! I want to see where you put the gunpowder in the dolls!

Aya:
Speaking of dolls, have you seen the Hisou Tensoku? That seems to move very much like a doll as well.

Aya:
I'd like to see a newspaper from outside for reference. Certainly topics of mockery are the most well-received?

Aya:
A television... guide? I don't know what that is but it sounds interesting!

Aya:
It seems like fun underground too. You think we can live underground too?

Aya:
Even though you are active, I can't imagine you starting up incidents.
Are you hiding something?

Aya:
The "Next Week's Deceased Corner" was unpopular. It didn't seem to be very accurate.

Aya:
Just as I thought, it's possible to predict earthquakes, isn't it? I'm very interested in that.

Aya:
The article on the habitual behaviors of the oarfish was a hit with the intellectuals. Even though I just filled it with imagination.

Aya:
I'm dying to know just how bad the fabled poor cuisine of Heaven is.

Aya:
Do the Celestials not read my newspaper? Haven't you heard the saying "Voice of Heaven & Speech of Man"?

Aya:
Ah, the miko who couldn't give me any scoops. Are you still running around for the mountain lately?

Aya:
Actually, I think fairies are the most interesting. And the one over there is the most interesting of fairies.

Aya:
I have a lot to thank the Scarlet Devil Mansion for. Providing scoops, and the mass subscriptions, too.

Aya:
The hot spring beneath the mountain was a success. With it, you improve the mountain's economy. Just as expected from nuclear fusion!

Aya:
So you were there one who thought of the idea of the Hisou Tensoku? How does it work?

Komachi:
Shinto shrines refrain from anything relating to death right? I mean, you don't even hold funerals there...

Komachi:
Ahh, living in the Netherworld is so much like living in the human world. Dying and ending up in the Netherworld is the best.

Komachi:
Ooh, the breadth of the Sanzu River.... This is interesting news.

Komachi:
The Ministry of Right and Wrong also has something like an internal news memo.
The printing technology of the tengu is certainly very similar to that of the oni in Hell, isn't it? 
Just who in the heck came up with such technology, huh?

Komachi:
Oh? My expectations were that humans who presumed to speak for the gods themselves would be different somehow...

Komachi:
You look so bored. Alright then, I'll be your playmate from now on!

Komachi:
Living in the house of a devil like this is a pain, right? What, I'm just playing around a little bit. Don't get so angry.

Komachi:
Oh my, you say you are a hell raven of the Old Hell? Why would something that dangerous be aboveground?

Komachi:
The present Hell became a place where oni are well disciplined and injustices happen only rarely.
The oni of Old Hell were in cahoots with the sinners, such that there were even souls who didn't want to leave hell.
You guys should, rather than a Hell like that, try to look for work at the new Hell. How's that sound?

Komachi:
The frog who awoke from within the Earth, the snake who undyingly sheds
In the stages of life and rebirth, both of you can be seen as Gods who've completely transcended the cycle of suffering. Is that right?

Iku:
Humans and youkai gather at this shrine. Even though you don't say it's because of your appeal, they still gather here nevertheless.

Iku:
I don't know if it's because of the earthquake, but there's been rabble emerging from underground.

Iku:
The mountain of youkai which humans do not approach. It is peculiar that you live there.

Iku:
It seems you aren't cold to the core. Passion is always the charm of life.

Iku:
Do you suppose the residents of this estate ever thought of seriously closing the gate for good?

Iku:
You're a raven sealed in the old hell, I see. Though there are lots of other things coming from the underground....

Iku:
Gods with abundant faith have power but at the same time lose their freedom to use it. But you can use your power however you like.

Tenshi:
The geysers seem to be gushing up lately. They don't have anything to do with the keystone, probably.

Tenshi:
To boast of one's talents is to lose one's merits, don't you agree? You should be aware that before you were a god, you were a mere human.

Tenshi:
With passion you forget to eat, with joy you forget your worries. Maybe the lifestyle that Confucius strived for was one like yours.

Tenshi:
Mount Tai does not let its soil run. You should thank the devil who could put you here.

Tenshi:
Say, you're not related to the earthquake on the surface, right? Right?

Tenshi:
You're by yourself?
There were a number of things that came out from the underground. Are they your friends?

Tenshi:
Virtue is the source of vendetta. Curse Gods originally manifested from divine virtures.

Sanae:
This kind of destruction happened because you couldn't inspire enough faith? You should present yourself in a more divine manner.

Sanae:
Yes, after that we pitched in to help build the temple.
I say that but, there really wasn't much for us to do.

Sanae:
Why is it that the Forest of Magic is called the Forest of Magic? Well, old-growth forests are certainly rare but...

Sanae:
It doesn't seem that maids are really denizens of the fantasy world any more, don't you think? There are many in the streets.

Sanae:
That's quite a lot of dolls. I admire artisans.

Sanae:
Can't you make a big doll or something?
Well, I only want to see one but... A life-sized giant robot, that is.

Sanae:
Oh my heavens, there's books I've seen before! You have books from the outside world too.

Sanae:
Ah, this occult magazine... I used to read it often when I was younger.
I was concerned about it because I felt these kinds of magazines suddenly disappeared after the turn of the century.

Sanae:
It's fun just to imagine what that large marshmallow-looking thing of yours tastes like.

Sanae:
Don't those wings get in the way when you sleep?

Sanae:
Traditional manors sure are nice. I want to live in a big manor too.

Sanae:
Eh? A giant robot was built in the outside world?

Sanae:
That sake, what was it made from? It's incredibly potent...

Sanae:
It's okay, humans who catch rabbits to eat them don't even exist any more.

Sanae:
Recently, fewer and fewer people are reading newspapers. It almost feels as if it were a relic of a bygone age, right?

Sanae:
The Sanzu River or the Chikuma River, which is longer?

Sanae:
You swim in the clouds? Don't lumps of ice stick to your body?

Sanae:
Ah, thank you so much for the refreshing peaches.

Sanae:
I wonder how everyone trains~

Sanae:
Oh my, I heard fairies are just small fry but...

Sanae:
Tai Chi Chuan sure is amazing. I've even seen goalkeepers that can do it.

Sanae:
You're good at controlling so much high-power energy.

Sanae:
You're fond of taking action from behind the scenes, right? But in that case, I'll have to remain suspicious of you as well.

Sanae:
Just a little more... Couldn't you please give me a little more training? Because it seems the residents of Gensokyo like to be self-disciplined.

Sanae:
Something like winning a match can't be compared to a miracle!

Sanae:
Truly, anywhere I go, there always seems be someone wanting to fight. Everyone in Gensokyo seems so rough.

Sanae:
Fortunes have no credibility if there wasn't a fee.

Cirno:
Man, there've been more shrine maidens lately... but they're no different!

Cirno:
I can even freeze magicians!

Cirno:
I don't wanna work in a mansion like that!

Cirno:
Uhhh, have we met somewhere? Can't remember...

Cirno:
You keep your dolls close to your heart. You won't find any gaps in a fairy like that!

Cirno:
Your surroundings are full of unnatural naturalness!

Cirno:
I don't really get along well with phantoms...

Cirno:
Don't you make a lot of useless movements? Hehe.

Cirno:
You phantoms sure are crazy...

Cirno:
That's it, isn't it? You're just pretending to understand those hard-to-understand things you say, aren't you?

Cirno:
What's this? It's got such a captivating smell...

Cirno:
Huh? Shouldn't you be turning brown for the summer, rabbit?

Cirno:
Write more articlesÔΩû It doesn't matter if there's stuff to write about or not.

Cirno:
Fear death!? Not with that lame scythe.

Cirno:
Ice clings to your body when you're in the clouds... I hate that.

Cirno:
If you're going to pickle veggies, do it before you eat them! But you don't need to pickle a rock.

Cirno:
Man, a shrine maiden again! All shrine maidens do is exterminate youkai!

Cirno:
Check it out. That's why I'm the strongest.

Cirno:
In my hands, even a lotus falls apart!

Cirno:
Gyaaah„Éº

Cirno:
Doesn't this mean... I'm stronger than the sun?
Yes! There's no way I can lose!
I'm the strongest, most invincible fairy of all!

Cirno:
Go into hibernation! Sleep in the cold! Y'know? When you freeze a hibernating frog, it doesn't wake up... ever.

Cirno:
So weak! That was like doing warm-ups before practice!

Cirno:
I'm gonna have to look for some stronger opponents!

Cirno:
Even if some things can't be frozen, I've gotta keep my pride!

Meiling:
You really haven't been doing a good job at solving these incidents recently. At least, to me.

Meiling:
Hey, stop right there! The library's closed for the day!

Meiling:
I'm always just going easy, you see? I won't go easy on you in an official duel.

Meiling:
There are many who like to use dolls in their magic. A lot of them are up to no good too.

Meiling:
That's why I said we need to prepare for earthquakes! The books will be damaged, too...

Meiling:
Catching a white feather, huh...? That looks kind of cool. Maybe I can practice with you?

Meiling:
My, you don't look so well. Is it because it's noon?

Meiling:
Ah, that manga was interesting.
So the tengu don't only make newspapers, but these kind of books as well.
Well, I got scolded a bit after I borrowed that manga though.

Meiling:
You're....different from a jiangshi, right?

Meiling:
I felt some odd resistance. What are you wearing underneath your clothes?

Meiling:
Sure is hard to fight the little ones.

Meiling:
I always get lost in the bamboo forest. Though it's not like I go there often.

Meiling:
I've heard that you can have your soul stolen by a photograph...

Meiling:
A shinigami? I met one here just now.

Meiling:
Are you responsible for the lightning as well? Oh, you're not?

Meiling:
Oh, so in Heaven they study the classics of my homeland!

Meiling:
Eh? I wonder how you might be different from the shrine maiden of the east?

Meiling:
My hands are cold... I'll need to be rougher next time.

Meiling:
One must always improve one's self.

Meiling:
Nuh-uh, that kind of fireball is too dangerous.

Meiling:
Hiding in the ground...? Wasn't expecting that.

Meiling:
Ah, that was easy enough. Without vigorous movement, the body becomes weak.

Meiling:
Relying on projectiles is a waste. Beating them directly feels better.

Meiling:
You're all not there yet! You're all children compared to 4000 years of history.

Utsuho:
Hey, it's a shrine maiden. I can't tell you shrine maidens apart from one another.

Utsuho:
You couldn't even roast a bird with that firepower.

Utsuho:
Techniques that are only fancy tricks are no match for overwhelming power.

Utsuho:
That doll... I'm sure it can explode even further!

Utsuho:
You're relying on such pitifully boring magic aren't you. From now on it's nuclear power. The nuclear age.

Utsuho:
With nuclear fusion you could even practice metallurgy and make a great business of it!

Utsuho:
Restlessly moving around non-stop isn't going to change a thing! I'm not looking at you anyway.

Utsuho:
I'm someone who's become used to vengeful spirits, so normal phantoms are refreshing.

Utsuho:
Vengeful spirits...
They have good manners, but their true nature makes them painful to deal with.
Well, it's the fate of those who go to Hell: even after becoming vengeful spirits, they still continue to be burned.

Utsuho:
Eh? There are many people outside who terribly misunderstand nuclear energy and disapprove of its use? Even though it's so useful...

Utsuho:
It's okay, the Underground City can prosper. After all, the only weakness the underground had was that it didn't have a sun!

Utsuho:
Eh? There's something even more awesome than nuclear energy?

Utsuho:
I'm sorry, I hardly ever read newspapers.

Utsuho:
I wonder what's become of the new Hell? I really want to take a peek.

Utsuho:
Wow, there was a sea above the clouds too, wasn't there?

Utsuho:
So you're the perpetrator who inserted the keystone. It looks like the keystone was working effectively, the Lord of the land that it is.

Utsuho:
Hey, it's a shrine maiden. I can't tell you shrine maidens apart from one another.

Utsuho:
Wait, what? You didn't get blasted to smithereens. Was the output too low...?

Utsuho:
You're always trying to close in on me. Are you trying to burn yourself to death?

Utsuho:
The sun continues to burn today.

Utsuho:
Ah yes, the energetic hydrogens are magnificently fusing today as well!

Utsuho:
Nobody can withstand the ultimate energy!

Utsuho:
This still isn't enough to stop this surging feeling! The nuclear reactions within me force me to rage even more!

Utsuho:
Compared to the Sun, you are but a puny existence. But I won't show any sympathy.

Suwako:
Ahh, I wish you could share some of your recklessness with our Sanae.

Suwako:
You should visit the shrine on the mountain too sometimes.

Suwako:
Have you offered your thanks to the god of food? You'll get cursed, you know?

Suwako:
Oh? Do you make Oshirasama dolls?

Suwako:
If gods lose their power then magic can't be used, you know?

Suwako:
Phantoms better not hang around the shrine~

Suwako:
There also exist people who believe in bats as good omens. However even with such trivial amounts of faith, one could become a god, right?

Suwako:
Leaving a dead ghost here like this. Maybe there are no gods in the afterlife.

Suwako:
Oh my, our shrine really doesn't have any cracks you can slip through.

Suwako:
Were you a resident of the underworld? It's flourishing now, thanks to nuclear energy.

Suwako:
I heard that there are all kinds of gods where you come from.

Suwako:
I have a feeling that there are many here whose photos have never been taken.

Suwako:
Death is impure~ Shinigami are not gods.

Suwako:
An oarfish? I've seen them dried.

Suwako:
Celestials don't count on anything and have no expectations in life. So then, they are always ready to worship properly, right?

Suwako:
Train more and more! Until you're so strong that those below the mountain are afraid of you!

Suwako:
Frogs are weak against cold. Not going against nature is the most natural way to live.

Suwako:
We Japanese Gods accept all kinds of followers! Because there's more than 8 million of us we can't really do any rejecting anymore...

Suwako:
Looking good! Looking good! Today, as well, thanks to the straight-forward and honest youkai, nuclear energy is being used for peaceful purposes only.

Suwako:
Gods can split themselves infinitely~

Suwako:
Ahh, it's a good time to trick those who live aboveground into confronting their deepest fears isn't it?

Suwako:
Now, destroy the evidence, destroy the evidence. Picking on someone in a place like this can't be good for a god's reputation.

Suwako:
Now now, there's still more time! Rematch! Rematch!

Suwako:
Pay more respect to the earth. Otherwise, who knows? You might even get cursed. Heh heh.

Aya:
Now then, I've got a whole bunch of pictures Should I be writing the newspaper now?
Hm hm, what's with this picture?
A pure white picture where the subject is hidden by the danmaku...
That's a lot of pictures where you can't make anything out of.
Meh, I can always make up the content as much as I want.

???:
That's as far as you go!

Aya:
Hey, you're...

???:
Since I came out here, this is also as far as your newspaper will go!

Aya:
Aren't you Hatate of the Kakashi Thoughtographic Report? That delusional newspaper.

Hatate:
Surely yours is the delusional newspaper? Mine is a thoughtography newspaper.

Aya:
Though that doesn't make a big difference, what does a puny newspaper's reporter want with me?

Hatate:
Puny newspaper...that arrogance also ends today. I am declaring war on you!

Aya:
Declaring war, well, the newspaper competition is coming up. But I won't lose to you.

Hatate:
I won't be doing thoughtography from today on, I think I'll go out to gather material.

Aya:
You only realized it now? That's the duty of a reporter.

Hatate:
So I'll secretly take your interviews by thoughtography for reference.

Aya:
Ah, you realized how wonderful my materials are.

Hatate:
Your newspaper's subjects are well and good, but the actual content is horrible.
I'll write more interesting articles for the newspaper competition than that and win!

Aya:
Eh, you mean you're gonna steal my subjects!? I can't allow that! Go find other youkai!

Hatate:
The territory for newspapers should be free for all from the start.
There's no need for a newspaper with the best subjects bundled with the worst content.
So I'll eat up the Bunbunmaru Newspaper's articles and become a competition newspaper (spoiler) reporter! It's a contest!

Aya:
Hmph, fledging! Watch my photography techniques and be awed!

Aya:
What happened? Is that your reporter spirit?

Hatate:
I'm not done yet! Don't you need to catch your breath yourself?

Aya:
I've been hardened by a hundred battles, to me this is nothing more than a warm up.
I'm not like you, holing yourself up and using thoughtography.

Hatate:
A reporter's talent isn't just to move around.
To create a good interview you need articles of repeated revisions!

Aya:
Things like an article's content is nothing before the incident's quality.
The truth is that an incident that really catches interests can satisfy 90% of the people by just showing a picture!

Hatate:
Then there's no point in writing articles, is there!?

Aya:
If there's a point in writing articles, that is to fill up words. The number of words is a parameter that show the incident's scope.

Hatate:
Hmph, that's why you never get into the newspaper competition's rankings.
An article that suits the picture can catch the reader's interest and bring out the picture's charm even more.

Aya:
You're still green.
How many words do you think humans read?
For those humans who say they work seriously everyday and would be satisfied by a little entertainment,
and those humans who scan the headlines and pictures and feel like they know everything about the world,
they won't have the leisure to read the contents of the article and understand its essence.

Hatate:
Then watch me make a newspaper that even the humans will read the articles!

Aya:
Interesting, show me if you can. I would like to see the competition newspaper (spoiler) that you come up with.

Hatate:
Huhu, my spoiler articles may surpass yours and your newspaper will become the competition~
We'll become each other's competition newspaper (double spoiler) and aim for the best!

Cirno:
Alright, then! I got no need for these small fry!
Their house should be somewhere around here! Can't really remember, though...

???:
It's so noisy... Who's there?

???:
Who would be shouting in a place like...

Cirno:
There you are! I declare war on you!

Luna:
Oh! You're that ice one from a while back...

Cirno:
Yeah, and don't you forget it. You destroyed my house!.
I accept your challenge! Prepare yourself!

Luna:
...So the one who left the proclamation of war was you?
Geez. So it wasn't Reimu, what a shame.

Cirno:
When I get serious, I'm scarier than any shrine maiden! I'll freeze ya to death with my seriousness!

Cirno:
Hmph! She ran away?
Seems she left the forest, anyhow!
I may have only found one of them here, but I'll find the rest of those jerks and freeze 'em all!

Cirno:
This atmosphere... It's the smell of war!
So my house was gonna be attacked while I was away? That was close.

???:
Ah, there you are. I thought you'd return to your home base.

???:
I heard from Luna. So you've declared war on us, then?

Cirno:
Found ya! Better get ready!

Star:
Oh, but what would fighting your fellow fairies accomplish?

Cirno:
Didn't you guys destroy my house a while ago?

Star:
We were merely seeking your cooperation. Using force to twist your arm was Sunny's idea.

Cirno:
Cooperation? For what?

Star:
To terrorize human society via fairy power alone.
Fairies may be weak on their own, but if we all combine our power, no one can beat us!

Cirno:
Really? Sounds interesting.
Count me in! But there's one part I'd like to change.

Star:
Change?

Cirno:
I'm strong enough to take down humans all by myself! I don't need you guys' help!

Cirno:
Yeah, you see that? As I told you, I don't need your help!

Star:
We're not showing the true potential that we can realize through cooperation.
Which is stronger, one fairy or three? We should find out for sure!

Cirno:
Went running back to her friends? Looks like next round will be an all-out war!
However brutal the danmaku, I'll freeze it all!

Sunny:
Found you! I'll get you back for the other two!

Cirno:
Ha, found the last one!

Sunny:
I'm the strongest of us three! I'm gonna go all out against you, so get ready!

Cirno:
Hoho! I'll show you who's the strongest of all fairies!

Sunny:
Gck! Not bad!

Cirno:
You think you're getting away!?

Cirno:
This is the end of the line!
Come on out, you sunlight fairy (I forget your name)!

Sunny:
Hmhm, not bad at all.
Do you know what happens when you make enemies out of fairies?

Cirno:
Didn't you destroy my house first!?

Sunny:
Think of that as a request with force for your cooperation.

Cirno:
Who on earth would cooperate with one who attacked them!?

Luna:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Star:
Now, let's fight!

Cirno:
A-About time all three of you showed up! Wait, you wanna do this altogether?

Sunny:
Oh, aren't you the strongest all on your own?

Luna:
You don't know how wonderful cooperation can be.

Star:
Our strength is like that of a power play!

Cirno:
I don't care if it's a power play or a purple ghost!
Tripling a one still leaves you with all ones! Come on, let's settle this!

Sunny:
Buuut... If we win, will you cooperate?

Cirno:
You said something sbout that before. What do you mean?

Star:
For the terrorization of human society.

Cirno:
Ahahaha! Oh, really?
As I said, I can do that all on my own! Who do you think I am?!

Luna:
On that note, I don't think I've caught your name...

Cirno:
I'm Cirno, even crying babies freeze before me!
I'll settle this for good! Bring it on!

Cirno:
The small fry seem so nervous...
Someone menacing must be around here somewhere!

???:
What's the matter? Being so menacing...

???:
Don't you know it's riling up all the fairies?

Cirno:
Found you! How dare you destroy my house.
I hope you're ready.

Sunny:
Ready for what? You don't seriously think you can beat me?
Why, I could destroy a house, you know!

Cirno:
Ants can destroy houses if they want, too!

Sunny:
I wonder, how long will you be able to hold out?
Wouldn't it be more fun to join me and attack the humans together?

Cirno:
Sure, attacking humans is fun!

Cirno:
But do you really think I can have any fun with you underestimating me!?

Cirno:
You see that? Piece of cake!

Sunny:
Owowow... You are pretty strong, huh...
Just like Luna said, we can't do this alone.

Cirno:
She ran away, eh?
Opponents who just get off a snappy remark and flee have never had a taste of victory.

Star:
I hear you took good care of Sunny and Luna.
So by all means, me too...

Cirno:
Found you! You're the last one!

Star:
Well, for the moment, I'll try fighting you. For the moment.

Star:
Alright, that's enough!

Cirno:
You think you can run!?

Cirno:
I've already spent all day chasing you guys everywhere.
It's about time you accept the fact!

Star:
You're a fast one...
But it's alright now. We've caught you in the perfect situation!

Sunny:
Thanks for waiting!

Luna:
It'll be fine, it'll be fine. With us three, it'll definitely be fine.

Cirno:
Y-You mean you're going to fight as a trio?

Star:
There's nothing scary about fighting with trios.

Sunny:
If we win, we're the victorious army.

Luna:
If we lose, we're the rebel army. So we have to win by any means.

Cirno:
Hmph, turning one to three won't change the outcome of the match.
A team without a leader is weaker than a single member!

Luna:
The leader of us fairies are nature itself.

Sunny:
And your nature will go out of season along with the coming of spring.

Star:
You'll surely come to regret not declaring war in the middle of winter.

Cirno:
It's too bad. I'm in a different class from you guys.
No youkai or god can scare me! I'll show you that recklessness is bravery!

Cirno:
The fairy neighborhood seems sorta noisy...
Something about this feels menacing!

???:
Oh, there you are.

???:
Hey, could you help us out a little? We seem to have had war declared on us.

Cirno:
Oh, it's you! You're the noisy one!

Sunny:
W-Whaaat?

Cirno:
That's right, I haven't forgotten. You destroyed my house the other day, didn't you?
So I declared war on you! Which I just remembered now.

Sunny:
Wait, so perhaps the one who declared war on us...

Cirno:
It's me! And now you're gonna die! (Shinugayoi)

Sunny:
Fine, fine. But it's such a shame you're not Marisa.

Cirno:
I'm lucky I remembered. Now today will be the anniversary for my declaration of war!

Cirno:
That was no big deal! I knew I'd get to freeze sunlight someday.
Well now, better go and beat the other two.
I'll make 'em regret destroying my house.

Cirno:
It would seem their hideout is in the forest.
Not to brag, but I've never gone through this forest without getting lost!

???:
I thought there was a remarkably large lifeform reading...

???:
And it was you. I heard from Sunny, you know?
About how you attacked her.

Cirno:
Found you! Prepare yourself!

Star:
Why quarrel with a fellow fairy? Hm, perhaps you're just trying to kill time?

Cirno:
Hmph, you think this is some mere time-waster? This is war!

Star:
If war isn't a time-waster, then I wonder what else it could be?

Cirno:
I--I guess it's a... fairy-waster?

Star:
In the first place, the incidents youkai cause are all waste of time.
But even though your fight all by yourself, I wonder if it could be waste of time.

Cirno:
Hello, invincible fairy here! Make fun of me and you'll get burned!

Cirno:
That makes just one left. Where'd she go?

Star:
Everybody went to do different things today...
But next time we meet...!

Cirno:
You won't be doing different things next time, you mean?
I'm not gonna chase you down! Next time I see ya, you're goners!

Luna:
Ohoho, I found you!

Cirno:
Alright! You make... um, ooone, twooo...
That probably makes three! Now die!

Luna:
Sorry to say, but the night is my specialty. This is where your advance ends!

Cirno:
Pfft, I stay up late all the time! Just gimme something interesting to keep me awake!

Luna:
This is rough...

Cirno:
You think you can run!?

Cirno:
It's about time you wake up and smell the roses!
You should really regret making me your enemy now!

Luna:
Oh my, you caught me up such fast?
But, I don't have to worry any more. You don't stand a chance.

Cirno:
Sounds like you're just being a sore loser to me.

Sunny:
Thanks for waiting!

Star:
Now, let's fight!

Cirno:
A-About time all three were present! Now we can fight as much as we like.

Luna:
I'm sorry. We just happen to be comrades.

Sunny:
When the Three get together...

Star:
They can fail like Manjusri!

Cirno:
Adding two more isn't anything special.
It's just like somebody said! The margin of error can be as big as five.

Sunny:
So, what? Is our cooperation in error?

Luna:
You ought to feel that margin with your whole body!

Cirno:
This sure is getting interesting...

Cirno:
I am Cirno, always doing Omiwatari! 
I'll deal with you all together! Bring it on!

Cirno:
Uhhh, where IS their house?
I kinda forgot, but it's OKÔΩû All roads lead to somewhere!

???:
I heard from Sunny.

???:
About how you beat the tar out of her suddenly. What'd you do that for?

Cirno:
Hey, there you are!
I'll return the favor for destroying my house with frozen terror.

Luna:
Oh, right, I forgot all about that house-destroying thing, it was so long ago.
B-But hey, calm down, now. Won't you take a look around?
See, aren't the cherry blossoms so pretty?

Cirno:
Wow, you're right!

Luna:
Forget about that ancient nonsense. How about we look at the flowers tonight?

Cirno:
The beauty of these cherry blossoms...

Cirno:
It lifts my spirit! Now get your danmaku ready!

Cirno:
Piece of cake!

Luna:
No wonder Sunny was beaten.
I'll have to retreat here...

Cirno:
This is when a smart person would let their enemy escape on purpose!
Letting her escape on purpose... umm... Wait, what am I doing?

Star:
I figured you'd get here pretty soon.
Miss Ice Fairy.

Cirno:
So I was right!
Your home base was here in the forest! I knew it all along!

Star:
Alright, that's enough!

Cirno:
You think you can run away!?

Cirno:
This war was short although it seemed short.
Once I beat you, I proclaim this war over!

Star:
The way you act is pitifully easy to sense.
You're quite a fool for not noticing you've been lured here.

Sunny:
Yeah, that's right!

Luna:
Precisely. Now, let's finish this.

Cirno:
Hey, what? But I already beat you two and stuff...
So you saying you're gonna make this two-on-one? CowardsÔΩû

Luna:
Er, it's three against one.

Sunny:
But we three are as one.

Star:
Meaning that, so far, it's been one against three parts of one.

Cirno:
Uhhh...
So you mean... I've been the coward all this time?

Star:
Right! You dirty coward!

Sunny:
Yeah, that's right!

Luna:
Er, no, that's not really what I was trying to say...

Cirno:
Well, I'm redeclaring this war a one-on-one!

Cirno:
I'm an ice fairy who can pound a nail in with a banana! 
And this unstoppable ice fairy's gonna win fair and square!

Cirno:
Ahaha, freezing the cherry blossom petals is no trouble at all!
But... Where was I going? And why am I going...?

???:
I thought there was a large reading...

???:
And it's coming from you.

Cirno:
Ah, it's you! Umm, I feel like there's something I needed to do with you...

Star:
If you've got the time, won't you cooperate with us?

Cirno:
Cooperate?

Star:
In terrorizing human society. It'll be just us fairies.

Cirno:
What's that? That sounds like fun!

Star:
Yesterday, somebody declared war on us.
But if we surprise them, victory'll be a cinch, right?

Cirno:
Ahhh! I just remembered!
I was the one that declared war on you guys! So die!

Star:
Huh? Wh... wai...

Cirno:
You were doomed the moment we met.

Cirno:
You should feel the rage of a ruined household!

Cirno:
Umm, there were three of them, yeah.
I'll have to strangle the other two, as well. Just to be fair, you know.
I oughta punish those who'd disrupt the harmony of fairy society!

Cirno:
I'm pretty sure they live somewhere around here...
Well, all roads lead to me. So I have no problems with getting lost!

???:
Oh, you came here.

???:
I heard from Star that you attacked her.
I'm wondering what're you up to.

Cirno:
I'm not up to anything! Weren't you the ones who destroyed my house?
This is war! And war is about danmaku!

Sunny:
Huh? Wasn't your house destroyed in winter? Why are you bringing it up now?

Cirno:
I just forgot about it for a while, okay?

Sunny:
We just want to gather up our fairy power and play grand pranks on humans, that's all.
Even if you're strong, you're no match for us three, see?
So c'mon, work with us. Under our flag!

Cirno:
Hmph! My house was destroyed only 'cause I wasn't there!

Cirno:
I've fought youkai, you know! I'm nothing like you smarty-fairies!

Cirno:
How's that? Give up?!

Sunny:
Owowow... I'll have to retreat for now...
Next time, though, you're going down for sure!

Cirno:
You don't say "for sure" on your knees...
Now, where's the last one? Maybe she went off to the lake while I was gone...

Luna:
I've been waiting.
I hear you took good care of Sunny and Star.

Cirno:
Ehehe... Sorry it had to be so soon, but time to die!

Luna:
The night is my specialty, so I won't be beaten so easily! (Or so I'd like to say.)

Luna:
This is rough...

Cirno:
You think you can just run away like that!?

Cirno:
You can't keep running from me forever!

Luna:
Oh my, you caught up to me already?

Cirno:
I'll send you where I sent your friends!

Luna:
No need to say that; I'm already with my friends!

Cirno:
Huh? That so?

Sunny:
Thanks for waiting!

Star:
Let's beat her up this time!

Cirno:
Huh, you guys really are here.

Luna:
The three of us are as one.

Sunny:
Though a single arrow is broken easily, when three are bundled together...

Luna:
The arrows run out three times faster!

Cirno:
That's cheating! You're making this a three-on-one fight?

Luna:
Yes!

Cirno:
Well, if I were in a trio, too...
Wouldn't my share of the loot be one-third? I'd hate that!

Star:
However greedy you may be, if you don't win, your reward is a flat zero.

Luna:
Fairies are weak, so their victory is in numbers!

Cirno:
Nah, I'm fine going solo. I'm strong enough on my ownsome!
Breaking three arrows at once should be faster than breaking them one by one!

Cirno:
I had a bad feeling that when I came back, things would be all crazy...
These fairies are way too excited! Proof that someone vicious is here!

???:
Ah, I found you.

???:
I heard you attacked Star. What happened? What's making you so vicious?

Cirno:
Hey, found you! My fairy sensor isn't just for show!

Luna:
But... what did you attack Star for?

Cirno:
Umm... well, look, the group that destroyed my house in winter WAS you guys, right?
Well, I've got a grudge! Now freeze to death!

Luna:
Winter? House? Ummm...
Quite an old story by now... I mean, isn't it already cherry blossom season?

Cirno:
I-I could have attacked you back in winter, sure...
But then, it wouldn't have been a fair fight!

Cirno:
Winter is my specialty! But I'm no slouch in spring, either!

Cirno:
No comeback, huh!?

Luna:
This is rough...
For the moment, we'll have to refine our strategy.

Cirno:
In general, there's never been another fairy I've fought that's been a match for me!
Well, off to bully the third one. Oh, and I'll have make preparations for flower-viewing.

Sunny:
Don't come waltzing in with your guard down! I'll get you back for the other two!

Cirno:
Oh yeah, that's right. You guys live in the forest!

Sunny:
Enjoy that superiority while you can!

Cirno:
With you, this'll all be over! Now, we fight!

Sunny:
Oof! Not bad!

Cirno:
You think you can run away!?

Cirno:
It's about time you wake up and smell the roses!
Come on out! Sunlight fairy or whatever your name is! (I forgot.)

Sunny:
To think you'd be so mad only about your house being destroyed while you were away...

Cirno:
Well, it's not really the house that's important...
It's more about having to put up with you putting me down all the time!
I'll make you triple pay for that!

Luna:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Star:
Now, let's fight!

Cirno:
T-Triple...?

Sunny:
If we're going to triple pay for that...

Luna:
There should be no problem with us tripling ourselves.

Star:
If we weren't tripled, there would be an imbalance, you see.

Cirno:
R-Right...
Well, I guess things are finally balanced now.

Sunny:
That they are. Now we can fight as much as we like.

Cirno:
As much as we like on both sides, of course.

Cirno:
I've been going easy on you 'til now, but now I'm gonna get serious.
On a night of spring when the cold returns, it's time for you to run out of sake and freeze to death!

Cirno:
According to my tengu source...
There's a human around here with some spare time since they're done flower-viewing.
But it'll be a piece of cake whoever it is! Can't be stronger than the strongest!

???:
What's up?

Marisa:
Boy, you sound really riled up, huh?

Cirno:
Piece of cake, piece of cake, Tower of Pisa cake! Okay, it's go time!

Marisa:
Did ya eat somethin' weird or what?

Cirno:
Yes I did!
I've got no enemies left in the realm of fairies.

Cirno:
My next opponent will be a youkai! I'll beat a youkai and be the strongest!

Marisa:
Is that why ya tailed me? But I'm a human, y'know...

Cirno:
C'mon! I challenge you!

Marisa:
Oh well, I was gettin' pretty bored anyway.
Suppose it's fine to play around a bit.

Cirno:
That attitude won't last long. I've got the power to freeze bullets.

Marisa:
Ya don't say! Very interestin'.

Cirno:
I can't freeze lasers, though...

Marisa:
Hm, well, don'tcha think it'll be difficult facin' someone with lasers like me?

Cirno:
I'll try anyway.

Marisa:
Eh, whatever. I'll go easy on ya.
I'll just use my lasers that won't kill ya if ya touch them.
They'll just chip away at yer motivation.

Cirno:
Hmph, my ice will protect me! Come on, gimme all you got!

Marisa:
How entertainin' could a fairy as my opponent possibly be?
If you can't be the subject of the talk, it's yer responsibility to be the seed of my subject!

Marisa:
Not bad! Where'dya get that kinda power...?

Cirno:
I'm still feeling fine! No problem at all! I beat you SO fast!

Marisa:
Eh, whatever, sorry for puttin' ya down, I guess. Now we're gonna play with some REAL danmaku!

Marisa:
What the... You're that strong? This is kinda nuts.

Cirno:
Oof... g-gimme a break soon, pleeease?

Marisa:
Hmph, this'll be the last one. You'll get shattered before anybody even knows it!

Cirno:
How's THAT!?

Marisa:
P-Pretty good, really...
Well, I really did go easy on ya, y'know. With the non-deadly lasers.

Cirno:
Owowow... I think this is enough for you today!

Marisa:
Hey, that's my line...
(Regardless, even fairies aren't to be scoffed at...)
(It seems so weird to be calling stupid fairies not stupid...)
(Even if I had pulled out my most powerful lasers, she could've been trouble...)

Cirno:
What's the matter?

Marisa:
Nothing. Just a little worn out.
Back on topic, why did ya attack me?

Cirno:
Uhhh... because the mumble mumble was so-and-so.

Marisa:
That's not how you use "mumble mumble so-and-so."

Cirno:
(Mumble mumble, so-and-so...)

Marisa:
A fairy war? And since you're feelin' confident, you're takin' on youkai??

Cirno:
That's right.

Marisa:
But I'm a human.

Cirno:
But anyway, I'm out of power. I'm heading home and going to sleep!
I am triumphant! Strongest fairy, comin' through!

Marisa:
A war among the fairies, huh...? So somethin' fun was going on behind the flower-viewing?
I wonder if I could hear more about it from the seat of a flower-viewer...
Owww, I'm pretty beat up. I'd better get home and sleep, too.

Reimu:
Now then, I'd better beat these phantoms' boss!

???:
Oh, do we have visitors?

Yuyuko:
Hold on a moment, I'll prepare some tea.

Reimu:
You don't have to bother.
Would you tell me what exactly you plan to do by getting these spirits so riled up?

Yuyuko:
Mm? What do I plan to do, indeed?

Reimu:
You need to keep them in check! I mean, they're just ghastly.

Yuyuko:
Well, I don't know exactly what's going on...

Yuyuko:
...but if you want to know about the spirits, you'll have to start with beating me!

Yuyuko:
So? What exactly were you talking about?

Reimu:
Well, you see all these spirits swarming around? Yeah, what are those?

Yuyuko:
These are divine spirit children. Fleeting thoughts, born from the prayers of humans.
Ghostly as they may be, they're not related to the spirits here.

Reimu:
I see. So coming to the Netherworld was a mistake?

Yuyuko:
I'll give you a hint.
The cemetery behind the temple isn't suspicious.

Reimu:
Hmm...

Reimu:
There really are more spirits gathering around the temple than in the Netherworld.
Still, it's strange...
Yuyuko said these were "divine spirits"...
But are divine spirits really supposed to be this numerous and shoddy?
These aren't so much divine spirits as just the voices of souls taken shape...

???:
Good morning.

???:
You always gotta give a proper greeting.

Reimu:
Er, uh, good morning.

Kyouko:
One of Myouren Temple's precepts is "greetings are a mental oasis."

Reimu:
Ah, that's right, this is a youkai temple.

Kyouko:
Sure is. It's a temple for youkai that is kind to youkai.

Reimu:
Well, then I'll have to exterminate you right away!

Kyouko:
My morning duties are sweeping, cooking, and meeting challengers.
Let human screams echo throughout Gensokyo!

Kyouko:
Beating me won't help anything, you know...

Reimu:
Well, you're a youkai. It's necessary anyway.

Kyouko:
What are you here for?

Reimu:
Hm? Just checking up on things.
The divine spirits don't appear to be gathering within the temple itself...
It's the cemetery that stinks. Divine spirits in the cemetery, huh...

Reimu:
Hm, you're that‚Äî

Kogasa:
You finally came.
There's this girl I've never seen before keeping watch back there.
But no matter how much I shoot her, I always lose by time out...
So could you do something about her? Please.

Reimu:
A youkai requesting a youkai extermination...
Fine, then. I'll beat you all at once.

Reimu:
Where could this mysterious girl be?
She said she was "keeping watch"... but I wonder what she's guarding.

???:
Dooon't come any closeeer!

???:
This is no place for the likes of any of you to enter!

Reimu:
Huh?

Yoshika:
We are fighters (jiang shi) , arisen to protect this magnificent mausoleum.

Reimu:
So you're a zombie?

Yoshika:
That's right, I'm a zombie.

Reimu:
You've got really good complexion for a zombie.

Yoshika:
Did you come to visit a grave?

Reimu:
I came to check up on these divine spirits.

Yoshika:
Divine spirits? What're those? Are they easy to absorb?

Reimu:
Huh? You're not the one, either? How odd...

Yoshika:
Whatever the case, I was resurrected to protect this area from the temple's inhabitants!
You shall become one of our companions! By the danmaku awakened from a deep sleep!

Yoshika:
Whooorgh! I'm done fooooor„Éº

Reimu:
Now, spit it out! Just what were you protecting?

Yoshika:
U-Uh... ugh, oogh...

Reimu:
Huh? Time to sink back into the earth already?

Yoshika:
Zombies are eternal and undying!
Who are you?

Reimu:
I've had enough of this. Pity that your head's rotted away, too.
Oh well. I'll just have to press on ahead.

Yoshika:
Ahhh... at last...
The door to the great mausoleum will finally open...

Reimu:
There's no question. This is where the divine spirits are gathering!
And it's clearly apparent, too.

???:
Ah, that was quick.

Reimu:
Who are you? Could it be...

Seiga:
It seems you took care of my cute underling just now...

Reimu:
Cute underling? You mean that rotten underling?

Seiga:
Yes. She's so rotten and cute, isn't she?

Reimu:
I see. So you were manipulating that corpse.
What are you doing, leaving that ill-bred and pointless guard out here?

Seiga:
Ill-bred and... pointless?

Reimu:
Yeah, pointless. Her head's rotten. She isn't any use as a guard at all.

Seiga:
Ah, but there is a point, after all.

Yoshika:
Hup.

Seiga:
See? My jiang shi's selling point is her toughness.

Reimu:
...
So you don't realize that you have to sit out a round if you get beat, huh?

Seiga:
Now, can you handle another round? With this girl who has absorbed all the divine spirits that gathered in the tomb.

Reimu:
No need to ask!
Now you've made it clear! The disturbance among the divine spirits is the work of someone with evil intentions!

Seiga:
As expected from one of Gensokyo's shrine maidens. To think you could hurt someone who has been trained in creating elixirs of immortality.

Reimu:
Now, stop these abnormal divine spirits!

Seiga:
I haven't done anything to the divine spirits.

Reimu:
You lie! You can't hide all these divine spirits gathering here.

Seiga:
They are here because she is about to be resurrected...
She can embrace many desires, after all. Even human desires would gather around her.

Reimu:
So the evil overlord is about to be resurrected, or something like that?

Seiga:
Evil overlord? No, not at all.
The evil overlord has already been resurrected. Just a little while ago.

Reimu:
Hm?

Seiga:
The one who set up a temple here as if to prevent her from resurrecting...
She's the true evil overlord. She built a temple to protect the youkai.
The person within here is a sage upon whose shoulders rests the future. She will surely destroy all youkai for us.

Reimu:
Hmmm. Well, whatever.
Either way, I'm gonna fight. I don't want to let anyone weird get resurrected.

Reimu:
This is another strange tomb, huh...

???:
Ahh... the fateful day hath finally come.

???:
Thou who hast praised my resurrection: speak now, and name thyself.

Reimu:
I didn't praise anything.

Futo:
Hm?
Pray tell, what design hath led to my resurrection?

Reimu:
I dunno.
I'm just here to stop suspicious characters like you from resurrecting.

Futo:
Hm. I see.
Art thou the final trial I must conquer, that I may be resurrected in full?

Reimu:
How did it end up like this? You dead people are all morons.

Futo:
Very well!
I shall vanquish thee, and so return to the world of the living in full. Then, the Crown Prince shall rise anew.
Know that I harbor for thee no malice in mine heart.
Now, prepare thyself, for I shall demonstrate the fusion of the secret art of the Mononobe and the way of the Tao upon thee!

Futo:
Wh-what madness is this...? Truly, thine strength is...

Reimu:
Is it over? That wasn't really that great.

Futo:
To have suffered so sound a defeat...
To what ends hath I slept for these fourteen-hundred years hence...?

Reimu:
How did you keep track of time while you were sleeping?

Futo:
Hmm, these shades that doth linger about thee are...
Vulgar spirits?! Mayhap...?
The Crown Prince hath been resurrected!
I cannot remain here like this. Excuse me, if thou wouldst.
'Twas a rousing battle. Thou hast mine gratitude!

Reimu:
Ah.
She got all excited and left on her own.
Anyway, what's with that "'twas a rousing battle" stuff? She lost.

Reimu:
There's so many divine spirits gathering, it's like a starry sky...
Somehow...
...this place doesn't feel very sinister at all.
Was I mistaken?

???:
I have observed all of your actions.

???:
You are truly a wonderful human. I have much to learn from you.
Well, there's nobody who doesn't have something they could learn, I suppose...

Reimu:
How long have you been watching me?

???:
I have looked back to before you were born to watch you.

Reimu:
Hm?

???:
I have seen your occupation as a youkai exterminator, but I have also seen your camaraderie with youkai.
You are friends with the youkai monks who aimed to deny my resurrection, are you not?

Reimu:
You mean Byakuren? She's just a business rival. (In a religious sense.)
Anyway, what was that about looking into the past?

Miko:
While I was alive, I had the ability to understand ten people's words simultaneously.
During my long sleep, I acquired the power of faith, and now, I can hear humans' desires.
Desire tells of a human's true character.
To understand the ten desires of a human is to know them fully.
In the past, the present... And the future...
Your next line is...

Reimu:
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
Give me a chance to talk, too! I've come all this way, you know!

Miko:
There is no need for that.
Because I have already seen through all of your actions.
That's right, you will now bare your fangs at me. Without any reason to do so.

Reimu:
That's right. Without any reason to do so!

Miko:
This era, when humans deny my existence and I have become legend, is what I was waiting for!
Now, attempt to defeat me! And I shall become a living legend!

Tojiko:
Have at it!

Futo:
Please let me handle this!

Tojiko:
You damn fool!

Futo:
Your pathetic power isn't worth talking about!

Tojiko:
Good grief!

Futo:
You haven't won yet!

Tojiko:
Once again?

Futo:
Haven't we done enough?

Miko:
Enough playing around!

Marisa:
The Netherworld at night is eerie as ever...

???:
Oh, do we have visitors?

Yuyuko:
Hold on a moment, I'll prepare some tea.

Marisa:
Hold up! No need to waste your time on me.
I just wanna hear if you know anything about these strange spirits.

Yuyuko:
Spirits? Do you mean me?

Yuyuko:
If you want to check up on me, you'll have to beat me first!

Marisa:
Alright, now tell me like you promised. What are all these spirits running around?

Yuyuko:
These are divine spirit children. Bundles of human desire.
Ghostly as they may be, they're not related to the spirits here.

Marisa:
Desires? Thought it might be something like that. Sorry for the bother.

Yuyuko:
So, where will you go now?
Perhaps to the cemetery behind the temple?

Marisa:
Oh-hoh?

Marisa:
Man, this temple's 
totally aimed at youkai. 
A youkai was even on sweeping duty earlier...

???:
Good morning.

???:
Good morning!

Marisa:
Oh, mornin'.

???:
You're too quiet!

Marisa:
You're the one that's too loud! It's way too early.

Kyouko:
Heheheh. You mean to deny my purpose of existence?

Kyouko:
Despite how I may seem, I'm a yamabiko.
If I turn a deaf ear after getting my specialty yell rejected, I'd be losing my worth as a youkai!

Marisa:
Getting squabbled by a youkai... Today ain't my lucky day.

Kyouko:
"Today ain't my lucky day."

Marisa:
An echo spirit, huh? So all you do is parrot things back?

Kyouko:
That is all I do, so don't tease me about it.
Well, where are you off to?

Marisa:
She mentioned the cemetery behind the temple...
Feels a little awkward messing around near graves.

Marisa:
Hm, you're that‚Äî

Kogasa:
Ah, you came at a good time!
I saw this girl I've never seen before keeping watch back there.
But no matter how much I shoot her, I always lose by time out...
So hey, do something about her„Äú Please.

Marisa:
Oho, even a youkai's at a loss? Very interesting.
I'll wipe you two out together!

Marisa:
Where's this girl Kogasa mentioned?
Hm, I feel a warm breeze...

???:
Dooon't come any closeeer!

???:
This is no place for the likes of you to enter!

Marisa:
Is that so? So who is it a good place for?

???:
Ummm... who is it good for?

Marisa:
What are you protecting?

???:
Um... what am I guarding...

Marisa:
This won't result in a conversation. Is your brain rotten?

Yoshika:
Rotten as I may be, I'm a jiang shi. Right! I remembered!
We were revived to protect the mausoleum!

Marisa:
Jiang shi, eh? Ah, so you really are rotten.

Yoshika:
I can't let you enter! Though I can't quite remember why...
But if you want to become one of us, feel free!

Yoshika:
Curse yooooou! I'm done fooooor„Éº

Marisa:
Ah, geez...
Fighting a zombie in a cemetery? What kind of third-rate movie is this?

Yoshika:
This isn't a movie? I'm a zombie?

Marisa:
So do you know anything about these divine spirits?

Yoshika:
Divine spirits? What're those? Are they nutritious?

Marisa:
I was a fool to think I could make conversation with a corpse...
Well, you rest in peace, now. Amen.

Yoshika:
When it's 10p.m., wake me up.

Marisa:
I'm not gonna wake you up!

Marisa:
Ooh, there's a meaningful-looking door...
No choice but to go in!

???:
Welcome. So you've been guided here as well?

Marisa:
Yeah, I was. By some weird ghosts and a corpse.

Seiga:
It seems you took care of my cute underling just now...

Marisa:
So then you're its boss?
Dumping corpses isn't very admirable behavior, y'know.

Seiga:
Dumping? No, no, I haven't dumped her at all„Éº

Yoshika:
You called?

Seiga:
Once you've become a corpse, you can't die any further than that.

Yoshika:
Whuuuh, who are you? What time is it?

Marisa:
...Still morning.

Seiga:
An early riser! Good girl, good girl.

Seiga:
Now, now, are you up to another round, With this girl who has absorbed all the divine spirits that gathered in the tomb?

Marisa:
Guess there's no choice.
If you want to kill the general, shoot his horse! Prepare youself!

Seiga:
How splendid. You're not an ordinary human, are you?

Marisa:
I'm an ordinary magician.

Seiga:
Come, come, no need to be modest. For a flesh-and-blood human to be able to fight me is truly amazing.

Marisa:
Okay, then, I'm an amazingly normal magician.

Seiga:
So, what is your goal here?

Marisa:
Ummm, what was it, again?
Ah, that's it! grave looting-- er, archaeological investigation! It's a pretty academic goal.
I'm also interested in the divine spirits gathering here. Academically.

Seiga:
Divine spirits, hmm?
They're actually vulgar spirits hoping for her powers to turn them into real divine spirits.

Marisa:
Hm?

Marisa:
What the... Where's the door on this thing?

???:
Aah... this fateful day hath finally come.

???:
Thou who hast praised my resurrection: speak now, and name thyself.

Marisa:
Congratulations.

Futo:
Thou mayest call me Mononobe no Futo.
Mine return doth indicate that one who wouldst deny the Crown Prince's resurrection hath appeared.
Is it not so?

Marisa:
Is that so? I really have no idea.

Futo:
It is most assuredly so.
I was laid to rest here that I might defend this tomb, if need arose.

Marisa:
Hmmm.
I don't really get it, but it looks like there might be some treasure waiting for me in that tomb.

Futo:
At last, thou hast revealed thy true nature.
The protection of mine house from such miscreant thieves as thee is the purpose of mine resurrection!
Inscribe into thy very body this fusion of the secret art of the Mononobe and the way of the Tao!

Futo:
Ugh! Hast thou conditioned thy body for this encounter?

Marisa:
Yeah, for my health.

Futo:
...Alas, mine power doth lack greatly its usual potency, so soon after resurrection.
In such a state as this, I was without recourse to prevent my defeat.

Marisa:
A lame excuse... Not that I mind, though.
Well, then, with that, I'll be investigating inside.

Futo:
No, stay a moment.
Hmm, these shades that doth linger about thee are...
Vulgar spirits!? Mayhap...
The Crown Prince hath been resurrected!
I cannot remain here like this. Excuse me, if thou wouldst.

Marisa:
Oi, oi, you're just gonna leave me here?
Well, whatever. I guess I can come in, then.

Marisa:
This place is bigger than I thought.
Now, then, is there anything of value around here?

???:
There is.

???:
This place is filled with priceless valuables that are irreplaceable.

Marisa:
Whoops, someone showed up.

Miko:
Have a look around.
These transient lights, like stars in the sky. Each and every one of them is a human desire.
Observe a human's desires, and you can understand the entirety of that human. Past, present, and future, as well.
One might say that this mausoleum is Gensokyo's Akashic Records....

Marisa:
Understanding everything from desires? I finally understand, now.
You gathered the divine spirits here, didn't you?

Miko:
That's right. Although, technically speaking, not entirely so.

Marisa:
Huh?

Miko:
These desires gathered here themselves, after instinctively sensing my resurrection.

Marisa:
How convenient...

Miko:
To one such as I, who has seen each of your ten desires, your past and your future are visible.
You will defeat me, and then search this mausoleum.

Marisa:
Ooh, so you don't mind if I beat you?

Miko:
You could never manage to govern over these desires either way.
My ability, to hear and understand ten desires at once, is necessary for that!
Now, attempt to defeat me! And lay bare your own desire!

Tojiko:
Have at it!

Futo:
Please let me handle this!

Tojiko:
You damn fool!

Futo:
Your pathetic power isn't worth talking about!

Tojiko:
Good grief!

Futo:
You haven't won yet!

Tojiko:
Once again?

Futo:
Haven't we done enough?

Miko:
Enough playing around!

Sanae:
I wonder if it's really advisable for the Netherworld to allow living humans in so readily...

???:
Oh, do we have visitors?

Yuyuko:
Hold on a moment, I'll prepare some tea.

Sanae:
Oh, no, don't mind me.. Anyways, I have business with you.

Yuyuko:
You know, you could at least start off with "sorry to bother you at this late hour" or something.

Sanae:
These divine spirits have suddenly started gushing out everywhere.
So would you know anything about the matter?

Yuyuko:
Hm... Divine spirits, you say...
You want to know about divine spirits, do you?

Sanae:
If you please.

Yuyuko:
Then it's a duel! Try and defeat me for it!

Yuyuko:
So, you wanted to know about the divine spirits?

Sanae:
(Did we really need to fight for that...?)

Yuyuko:
Something on your mind?

Sanae:
Well, I just figured someone who knows about spirits might know why they showed up so suddenly

Yuyuko:
Do you plan to put them to use for your shrine?
I don't know what's going on, either.
Ghostly as they seem, I know nothing about these divine spirits that are gathering toward the temple's cemetery.

Sanae:
Huh?

Sanae:
I just kinda beat down the girl who was performing her morning duties...
But everyone should still be asleep, so it shouldn't be a problem!

???:
It is a problem!

???:
I got careless thinking that you're just a human.

Sanae:
Ah, so you're doing well.
Great, that's great.
Anyway, the temple starts its mornings quite early, doesn't it?

Kyouko:
Well, yeah. That's just part of the liturgy.
I've gotten quite good at being able to recite sutras from memory.

Sanae:
That's great.

Kyouko:
Incidentally, attacking humans is also part of the liturgy.

Sanae:
Huh?

Kyouko:
A human scream to begin a morning at the temple! How wonderful!

Kyouko:
I'm done fooooor!

Sanae:
What a shout...!

Kyouko:
Oh, how this humble yamabiko still lacks training!

Sanae:
Er...

Kyouko:
What?

Sanae:
Could it be that you're a youkai?

Kyouko:
Huh?

Sanae:
Oh, thank goodness... I was worried I was fighting a monk.

Kyouko:
(Did she seriously think this was part of a monk's liturgy?)

Sanae:
Now then, she mentioned the temple's cemetery. So that's where I'll be off to!

Sanae:
Oh, you're...

Kogasa:
Ah, you came at a good time!
I saw this girl I've never seen before keeping watch back there.
But no matter how much I shoot her, I always lose by time out...
So hey, do something about her„Äú Please.

Sanae:
Huh? A quarrel between fellow youkai, perhaps?
That's just perfect! I'll take care of both of you at once!

Sanae:
Just where is this youkai Miss Kogasa was talking about?
Or was it even a youkai in the first place? I'll be disappointed if it's a human...

???:
Dooon't come any closeeer!

???:
This is no place for the likes of you to enter!

Sanae:
There you are!

Yoshika:
We are fighters (jiang shi) , arisen to protect this magnificent mausoleum.

Sanae:
J-jiang shi?

Yoshika:
That's right. We have had life breathed into us by noble spirits.

Sanae:
I know, I was watching. Tiantian was rather cute, wasn't she?

Yoshika:
What are you talking about?

Sanae:
Ah, no wonder I hadn't heard about "jiang shi" in a while. So you ended up here in Gensokyo (a place like this), huh...

Yoshika:
I don't know what you're talking about, but if you know of us, then you must understand!
If you're done in by our danmaku, you'll become a jiang shi too!

Yoshika:
Gwaaaaargh! I'm done fooooor„Éº

Sanae:
(I've heard so many agonized yells today.)

Yoshika:
But as long as life remains on this world, zombies will never perish.

Sanae:
Ah...
Ah, but you know...

Yoshika:
What?

Sanae:
Jiang shi have faded to fantasy, but zombies are really popular, right?

Yoshika:
That's good to know. I'm in a good mood. What is it you want?

Sanae:
Would you let me through?

Yoshika:
Oh, if I must. I'll just take a little nap.

Sanae:
...Farewell. I hope the sleep's eternal this time...

Sanae:
There was a heretical establishment like this beneath the newly-made temple...?
That's kinda disturbing.

???:
Welcome. Oh, it seems you're a human.

Sanae:
You're that one from before...

Seiga:
Beyond this point is the mausoleum of a great Taoist. 
Heretic humans are forbidden to enter.

Sanae:
Oh, my, a Taoist. So that jiang shi from before was yours?

Seiga:
Well guessed.
Just where has that girl gotten to?

Sanae:
(I beat her up... How should I tell her?)

Yoshika:
Good morning!

Seiga:
Oh, right at my side.

Sanae:
Huh? It's still alive?

Seiga:
Corpses can't die, you know. Isn't it wonderful?

Seiga:
Now, now, will it be another round? With this girl who has absorbed all the divine spirits that gathered in the tomb.

Sanae:
Ah, um, if you don't mind, I'd like to turn down the offer...

Seiga:
Well, too bad. It seems this girl has a grudge against you, too.

Seiga:
How splendid. You're not an ordinary human, are you?

Sanae:
Can you tell~?

Seiga:
So, what does a human like you want with the grand mausoleum?

Sanae:
Ummm...
What exactly is going on?

Seiga:
Huh?
Uh, right. 
An amazing person is about to be awakened.
These spirits were attracted here by her power and gathered of their own accord.

Sanae:
Huh, is that right?

Seiga:
Is that not what you wanted to know?

Sanae:
I don't think I really get it all that very well...
For now, why don't I just go on ahead through that door?

Seiga:
I see. Will you convert? You would make an excellent hermit.

Sanae:
Ummm, I don't want to be a hermit.

Sanae:
Gensokyo sure is mysterious...
To think that buildings like these are still lying buried beneath the earth...

???:
Aah... this fateful day hath finally come.

???:
Thou who hast blessed my resurrection: speak now, and name thyself.

Sanae:
Oh, someone's here.

Futo:
Who art thou that calleth upon me?

Sanae:
Well, I'm a god in Gensokyo, while acting as a shrine maiden on the side.

Futo:
A god, thou sayeth?
Dost thou come before me seeking to deliver me unto Heaven?
Then mayhap there was value in having once before tasted death.

Sanae:
No, I wasn't planning on that.

Futo:
...Then what design hast driven thee before me?

Sanae:
I'm not really sure of that myself. 
Somehow or another, I just felt something brewing in the air, so I came to have a look...

Futo:
Then thou art a lost child? 
Very well, I will cut through the haze of confusion that surrounds you.
Wilt thou bear witness as I demonstrate the fusion of the secret art of the Mononobe and the way of the Tao upon thee?!

Futo:
Kuh! What manner of being art thou?

Sanae:
Like I said, I'm a god while...

Futo:
It doth matter not. I now apprehend the purpose of mine resurrection.
The coming of a enemy most wretched hath returned me, one of the Imperial Guard, unto this waking world anew.
Is that not correct?

Sanae:
"Enemy most wretched"? How rude.
And anyway, what are these divine spirits? That's what I'm investigating.

Futo:
Divine spirits, sayeth thee...? Mmm, these shades that doth linger about thee are...
Vulgar spirits!? Mayhap...?
The Crown Prince hath been resurrected!
I cannot remain here like this. Excuse me, if thou wouldst.

Sanae:
Umm...
Do you mind if I come in?
I'm comin' in, I'm comin' in!

Sanae:
All these divine spirits...
That person just now called them "vulgar spirits", didn't she?
...Hmmmm.
That person just now's name was Mononobe, huh? It seems like I've heard that somewhere before...

???:
The Mononobe clan was destroyed.

???:
I witnessed it for myself.

Sanae:
!?

???:
Long ago, the Mononobe clan and I opposed one another for religious reasons.
To the public, it appeared as a confrontation between Shinto and Buddhism...

Sanae:
What are you talking about?

???:
I was said to be the Buddhist faction, but that was a ruse that I had prepared.

Sanae:
Umm... Who are you?

Miko:
I am Toyosatomimi no Miko. People call me Shoutoku Ou.

Sanae:
Shoutoku, Ou?! The one on the old 10,000-yen bill?

Miko:
What era are you talking about?

Sanae:
...I see. I get it now!
I expected that these divine spirits would be somehow connected to an immense source of faith, but...
Since a legendary person like you was resurrected, it's no wonder they just decided to gather on their own.
...Wait, that's not very convenient for my faith.

Miko:
Desire overflows from within you.

Miko:
I have no reason to fight with you. "Harmony is to be valued."

Sanae:
But going back empty-handed after coming all the way out here is kinda...

Miko:
I understand. If I read your heart's desires, there is no need for words. 
Wouldn't you like to fight me, and achieve some merit should you defeat me?

Sanae:
Uh, well, but--

Miko:
Pay me no mind. It will be beneficial towards my resurrection, as well.

Sanae:
?

Miko:
Now, attempt to defeat me. 
That will bring harmony to this world!

Tojiko:
Have at it!

Futo:
Please let me handle this!

Tojiko:
You damn fool!

Futo:
Your pathetic power isn't worth talking about!

Tojiko:
Good grief!

Futo:
You haven't won yet!

Tojiko:
Once again?

Futo:
Haven't we done enough?

Miko:
Enough playing around!

Youmu:
Hm...
It would seem the spirits are all headed in the direction of the village.

???:
Ah, Youmu?

Yuyuko:
Where are you going at this time of night?

Youmu:
Ah, Lady Yuyuko! I was thinking of going to investigate these divine spirits.

Yuyuko:
Huh? What half-asleep nonsense are you spouting?

Youmu:
Huh? Hasn't this become a serious matter?

Yuyuko:
What do you mean? Either way...

Yuyuko:
...if you say you're going to leave, you'll have to defeat me first!

Youmu:
How irrational...

Yuyuko:
Hm, not bad at all. You can go ahead.

Youmu:
You must have had a lot of time on your hands...

Yuyuko:
What is it?

Youmu:
What do you think of these divine spirits, Lady Yuyuko?

Yuyuko:
I doubt that some troublesome individual is about to make a return, or that there's any secrets or anything in, say, the cemetery behind the temple...

Youmu:
Hm?
A-anyway, I'll be off.

Yuyuko:
Bring me back a souvenir!

Youmu:
This temple has quite a lot of youkai about.
Could these odd spirits, too, be the work of the temple monk?
That isn't a very satisfying explanation, though.

???:
That's dangerous!

???:
What are you doing, swinging sharp objects on the pilgrimage path?

Youmu:
It's fine, isn't it? They're just youkai and fairies.

Kyouko:
The temple has a strict ban on killing!

Youmu:
Um, er, well, not like I was gonna slice them until they were killed...

Kyouko:
Anybody swinging around sharp swords and committing unneccesary killing in the temple...
...is to die here!

Youmu:
You youkai are as energetic as ever...
So, would you happen to know anything about the divine spirits?

Kyouko:
What's a divine spirit? Does it taste good?

Youmu:
...as expected.
Only a shrine would benefit from gathering divine spirits. I can't help but feel this isn't the work of a youkai...
But even if these formless spirits materialize, they'll just vanish right away.
They're nothing but essence of greed that's visible to the eyes at this point...

Youmu:
What do you want?

Kogasa:
Ah, someone swinging swords around... Oh, anybody'll do!
I saw this girl I've never seen before keeping watch back there.
But no matter how much I shoot her, I always lose by time out...
So hey, do something about her„Äú Pleeease.

Youmu:
Plead of help from a youkai? How bizarre.

Kogasa:
Heh heh heh! But we'll have to test if you're tougher than me!

Youmu:
Well, Lady Yuyuko told me to go to the cemetery, but...
Although she may not have actually said it...
Anyway, the spirits are really making a racket.

???:
Dooon't come any closeeer!

???:
This is no place for the likes of you to enter!

Youmu:
Ah, hello.
...Are you already dead? Maybe you're decayi...

Yoshika:
We are fighters (jiang shi) , arisen to protect this magnificent mausoleum.

Youmu:
Uh? Jia...? Ah, jiang shi, I see.

Yoshika:
Right, so knowing that, you should leave. Or otherwise become one of our companions.

Youmu:
Companions...? Sorry to say, but I'm actually in a similar state already.
But to still be loitering around this world because of a few lingering attachments...
I feel sorry for you.
Huh? Something feels... off.

Yoshika:
We aren't stuck in this world because we have attachments!
It is all so that she shall not be trampled upon by the temple's inhabitants again!

Yoshika:
Whaaaaat!!? I'm dyiiiiing!

Youmu:
Yes, yes, we get it, you're already dead.
A jiang shi with a charm stuck on her head... That must mean there's a master controlling you.

Yoshika:
Was there?

Youmu:
Of course, you also reeked of the possibility of such earlier...

Yoshika:
Huh? I stink? But I take such good care of my skin.

Youmu:
Sigh, zombie jokes...
Well anyways, I'll go search around for who's controlling you. I'm sure they'll have clues for me.

Yoshika:
My... master??
What the...
Wait, does that mean that dreadful religious war is upon us once again?!
...Er, who was that?

Youmu:
Here... My spirit-detecting radar is getting a signal!
Yes, this place is a tomb.

???:
Welcome. Ah, you're...

Youmu:
We just met back there, right? Who are you?

Seiga:
I'm Seiga Kaku. I'm currently living as a hermit.

Youmu:
A hermit... Ummm, that would mean...?

Seiga:
A hermit is a hermit. Perpetual youth, a clear mind, a sturdy body.
It seems you're the same sort of being. You've transcended life and death, haven't you?

Youmu:
No, uh, I can die.

Yoshika:
Die, you say!?
Dying's no good. Anything but that.

Seiga:
Oh, my, you're back quick.

Youmu:
My oh my. You resurrected quickly.

Seiga:
...What's that? You've got a grudge against this person in front of us?

Seiga:
So, will it be another round? With this girl who has absorbed all the divine spirits that gathered in the tomb.

Youmu:
So you're that thing's master! That saves me some time!

Seiga:
My faithful servant. Go eradicate the one who would deny this resurrection!

Seiga:
Oh, my, my, my, how splendid. The people of Gensokyo truly are talented.

Youmu:
Well, I am strong after all.
Now, I have something to ask you. These divine spirits gathering here...

Seiga:
It's okay, it's okay. The preparations should've ended right about now.

Youmu:
Preparation? For what?

Seiga:
These spirits that look like divine spirits are actually just common desires.
If you leave them be, they'll disappear soon. They won't do any harm.

Youmu:
...

Seiga:
She will be revived very soon.
Compared to that foreign prophet who resurrected three days after his execution...
...this will be much more divine and magnificent.

Youmu:
I don't know what you're scheming, but...
...the dead being resurrected can't be anything but a bad thing!
...or so I think so.

Youmu:
This is quite a big tomb.

???:
Aah, this fateful day hath finally come.

???:
Thou who hast blessed my resurrection: speak now, and name yourself.

Youmu:
Whoops, there's something in here.

Futo:
Thou art... inhuman, it wouldst seem.

Youmu:
Mmph, your body is covered with the stench of death.

Futo:
Aye, for I art no longer among the living. We are of a like kind, are we not?
Art thou not also a shikaisen?

Youmu:
Huh? No, I'm not.

Futo:
...Come again?
I s-see. Then I have judged you in error. Thou hast mine apologies.

Youmu:
You're a shikaisen...? Then you're in league with that wicked hermit from just now.

Futo:
Aye, and? What wouldst thou do?

Youmu:
Defeat those who rebel against the natural order and return them to the ground!

Futo:
Alas. And I had thought thee a kindred soul to me.
Thou who thinkest thou couldst return this fusion of the secret art of the Mononobe and the way of the Tao into the ground, come now and attempt such a thing with all your might!

Futo:
What is this? It wouldst seem thou art truly no ordinary being.

Youmu:
Yep, I'm no ordinary being„Éº

Futo:
For my defeat to have come to pass so readily... Thou must truly be a hermit of great fame.

Youmu:
I'm telling you, I'm not a hermit.

Futo:
Thou needest not play at humility.
Didst thou not come to bless the Crown Prince's resurrection as well?

Youmu:
...
(Maybe it's better if I play along at this point.)
T-that's right. I've come to deliver a blessing.

Futo:
I understand, I understand.
For wouldst not a blessing from one so powerful as thee be an event worthy of lauding?
Now, come this way...

Youmu:
I fooled that person back there to get in by saying I was a hermit...
Still, this is the first tomb I've seen that was so full of vitality.
And these divine spirits-- no, they're just materialized incarnations of desires, apparently.
Vulgar spirits... the low grade spirits among the vengeful spirit.
Who could stand to gain something from gathering these things here...

???:
No. They have gathered of their own volition.

???:
Desires gather at my side. In every single era.
Because I was made to listen to ten desires at once every day, I'm sure.

Youmu:
...

???:
...Hmm? You lack two desires.
From among the ten that I expected, your attachment to life and your envy of death are...

Youmu:
Sorry, but I'm afraid that I'm already half-dead.

Miko:
Is that right? Then you and I are comrades, are we not?

Youmu:
Huh?

Miko:
Those who walk a path toward eternal life as its endpoint?
Well, although you may already be a hermit or a shikaisen.

Youmu:
No, no, no, no.
I just denied being a hermit a second ago.

Miko:
There's no need to hide it.
I see and understand all. All that can be understood from seeing human desire.
Regrettably, your desires are lacking, and therefore incomplete.

Youmu:
Wait, no! I'm telling you, that's not it„Éº

Miko:
As a comrade, you understand what will happen next, don't you?

Youmu:
No, I don't!

Miko:
Two beings revived to eternal life must join together in combat, and join together in study of the Tao!
Now, try to defeat me!
And I will be resurrected as a statesman of eternal life!

Tojiko:
Have at it!

Futo:
Please let me handle this!

Tojiko:
You damn fool!

Futo:
Your pathetic power isn't worth talking about!

Tojiko:
Good grief!

Futo:
You haven't won yet!

Tojiko:
Once again?

Futo:
Haven't we done enough?

Miko:
Enough playing around!

Nue:
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected. The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

Reimu:
I've got a bad feeling about this......
It smells like youkai around here. Or, like wild animals.

???:
Well, now.

???:
Aren't you the miko of Hakurei?

Reimu:
Who're you?

Mamizou:
Oh, your pardon, please. I am Futatsuiwa from Sado.
Everyone calls me Mamizou.

Reimu:
Mamizou? What an odd name.

Mamizou:
Nue called me here, you see.
She said the youkai were in a pinch, and she wanted me to lend my assistance.

Reimu:
Well, I guess that's because I'm exterminating them all.

Mamizou:
Er, however, I'd heard something about a sealed saint having been released?

Reimu:
Oh, but I beat her. She was a piece of cake!

Mamizou:
Oh, ho, ho. My, but you sound confident.

Mamizou:
Now that I've arrived, though, I'll have to put you back in your place.
My transformative powers are still at their prime.
Now, shall we begin a ten-game match of danmaku transformations?

Mamizou:
*cough*, *cough*
Pray, might I be granted a brief respite?

Reimu:
Haven't you already done ten transformations?

Mamizou:
One, two, three......
Oh, indeed I have. I'd thought we were only at seven or eight.

Reimu:
Besides, doing any more won't let you beat me.

Mamizou:
Hmm, perhaps that is true. Then it, cannot be helped.
Still, what a shame that my long journey across the sea from Sado is for naught.

Reimu:
The sea?

Mamizou:
Oh my, can it be that you know not of the sea?

Reimu:
No, well, I saw it once. On the moon.

Mamizou:
Well, now! Just once? What a shame that is.

Reimu:
Why?

Mamizou:
Vast is the sea. Hundreds of times the size of Gensokyo.
There's no use in thinking yourself strong if you know so little of the world.

Reimu:
Oh, what's the difference? I can imagine the gist of it by listening to stories about them right here! Besides, you were still a pushover!

Mamizou:
Oh, ho, ho, ho! The frog in the well knows not the sea, as they say.
If you truly believe yourself to be strong...
It won't do to be afraid of plumbing into the depths of the open sea!

Nue:
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected. The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

Marisa:
What's that? They called in youkai reinforcements?
Can't help getting a bad feeling about this...

???:
Well, now.

???:
Who might you be?

Marisa:
Are you the youkai reinforcements?

Mamizou:
Why, indeed I am. I am Futatsuiwa from Sado.
In any case, I received word an unruly saint had been resurrected.
It seems she has reduced the youkai to a trembling mass.

Marisa:
Oh, was she really all that?

Mamizou:
Hm, so you know about her?

Marisa:
Of course, I'm the one that revived her (huge lie)

Mamizou:
Oho!

Mamizou:
What an amusing joke.

Marisa:
What if I said I'm not joking? (I'm joking)

Mamizou:
I'd think you were enemies. After all, are you not human?
Very well. I shall take this as a warm-up.
And now for a ten-game match of danmaku transformations! I wonder how many you can withstand?

Mamizou:
*cough*, *cough*
Pray, might I be granted a brief respite?

Marisa:
You think I'll let you?

Mamizou:
Oh my!
Prithee, I'm against animal abuse!

Marisa:
Well, whatever.
Aren't you supposed to be the youkai trump card? I figured you'd be amazing, but you're just a tanuki youkai.

Mamizou:
Oh, I hope you're not making light of tanuki.
We have quite a bit of influence in youkai society. You might even call us elite.

Marisa:
Elite?

Mamizou:
And in addition, my transformation power is among the top three of Japan.

Marisa:
Sure, but you're still just a tanuki, right?
The kind that drums on their bellies on the night of the full moon, right?

Mamizou:
You are making light of us, are you not? What do you call yourself?

Marisa:
I'm Reimu Hakurei!

Mamizou:
Marisa Kirisame, is it? I'll be sure to remember that.
I intend to take my revenge, so you'd best watch your back on the night of the full moon.

Marisa:
Hey, go after Miko, not me......

Nue:
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected. The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

Sanae:
The youkai's trump card, huh?
I wonder if it's a gashadokuro?

???:
Hey, I'm not some pile of bones.

???:
Who might you be? The Hakurei shrine maiden?

Sanae:
No, I'm not. Please don't group us together like that.

???:
Oh, my sincerest apologies. You seemed to be a shrine maiden, so...

Sanae:
Are you the youkai trump card Nue was talking about?

Mamizou:
Indeed I am. I am Futatsuiwa from Sado.
I was called so that saint wouldn't be allowed to have her way.
Now, who might you be?

Sanae:
Oh, um, I'm Sanae. I'm a shrine maiden in Gensokyo.
I'm doing some youkai extermination to help raise my faith.

Mamizou:
My, aren't you an odd one? How unusual to say that before a youkai.

Mamizou:
Why don't I spar with you a bit, then?

Sanae:
I was just thinking the same thing, Miss Tanuki.

Mamizou:
Ho! Ho! Ho! How long will you keep that confidence?
Now, shall we begin? a ten-game match of danmaku transformations!

Mamizou:
*cough*, *cough* 
Pray, might I be granted a brief respite?

Sanae:
Yes, I'd like to take a break, too.

Mamizou:
I must say, you are quite strong.

Sanae:
I am, right?

Mamizou:
I once had enough power to hold sway over one third (of the tanuki) of Japan.
But perhaps that's a thing of the past, now. To think I lost to a human like this...
Perhaps that nue overestimated my strength? I wonder...

Sanae:
...
Ummm... May I say something?

Mamizou:
Oh, what is it? Do you mean to catch me and make me into stew?

Sanae:
No, I don't think I'd want to eat something so gamey.
Geting all depressed won't solve anything!
You'll only sell yourself short if you think you're no good because you're so old.
Stay in the fight!

Mamizou:
Er, well, that is...
The way I speak is a habit of mine. I don't believe I'm particularly old.

Nue:
Ahhh, those bums all resurrected. The youkai world is in an uproar now.
So, I called in the youkai's trump card.
It's over for you right now, though!

Youmu:
The youkai's trump card?
So I guess Miss Miko's group weren't youkai after all.

???:
Hello, there!

???:
What might you be? Are you a youkai?

Youmu:
Ummm, well, I'm kind of like a half youkai......

???:
Hm, how indecisive.
I've been told the youkai are in fear of the resurrection of that saint.

Mamizou:
I've come to give 'em a pep talk.

Youmu:
Oh, I'm okay.

Mamizou:
By the by, I don't sense the aura of a youkai around you at all.
Are you truly a youkai?

Youmu:
I'm half-human, half-phantom. I don't know if you could call me a youkai or not...

Mamizou:
Hm, I believe I don't understand.
In any case, why not allow me to train you, as a first class youkai?

Youmu:
No, thank you.

Mamizou:
Come, now, was it not the youkai of Gensokyo that claimed to be in danger from that saint's return? 
Don't expect to make it through these times alive with such a half-baked response!
Allow me to do some strict training with my ten-game match of danmaku transformations!

Mamizou:
*cough*, *cough* 
Er, hmm, I suppose that will do.
You've gotten strong enough now. Yes, you may now consider yourself an initiate!

Youmu:
Oh, honestly.

Mamizou:
Still, if you have that much strength, why would you fear that saint so?

Youmu:
I wasn't afraid of her.
I already fought her and won.

Mamizou:
What was that?
Then, why on earth did I come all this way from far-off Sado?

Youmu:
Who knows? Why not try asking the folks here at the temple?

Mamizou:
A temple? However, I'm a youkai tanuki...

Youmu:
Oh, the Myouren Temple is a youkai temple.

Mamizou:
Is that so? How interesting.
A youkai exterminating shrine and a youkai temple...
What an interesting place this is.

Youmu:
By the way, you said you came from Sado, right?
Where is Sado? What kind of place is it?

Mamizou:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Would you like to hear more about me?
Telling all might take a while.

Youmu:
Oh, nevermind, then.

Mamizou:
Surely you needn't have said as much...
In any case, why don't we wait until we've rested a bit in the temple to talk?

Marisa:
Alright. 
I think it's time to settle this once and for all.

Marisa:
You ready?

Reimu:
Hmph, "settle"? So you think you're anywhere near good enough to beat me?
Fine. I'll embarrass you in front of the whole audience.

Marisa:
What's the matter? Didja eat something cursed?

Marisa:
S-shoot, my popularity's gonna take a nosedive...

Reimu:
I'll take care of all the youkai extermination from now on!

Reimu:
There are spectators in the sky as well, huh?
I guess I can't relax yet.
I'm pretty tired, but I've got to stay sharp and show off for the crowd.

Ichirin:
There you are, you rowdy shrine maiden.

Ichirin:
I've heard you're trying to take over Gensokyo in the name of youkai extermination.
I'm going to punish you with my soul of Buddhism!

Ichirin:
Good! Now we'll surely have more visitors to our temple.

Ichirin:
I hate to admit it... but I've utterly lost. My foe was too much...

Reimu:
That was easy!
At this rate, I'll be able to take down everyone, and
the faith in Gensokyo will be all mine...

Reimu:
Hmm, it sure is energetic around here.
I can't help but like this festival-like atmosphere.

Futo:
The next opponent of mine is yon shrine maiden? I shan't lose this time!

Reimu:
I'm not going to lose to you. Not now, not ever.

Futo:
How long shalt thou bear thine haughty poise?
My Taoist techniques hath awakened from a slumber of one thousand years,
fused with the futuristic essence of the modern day,
and hath been quite literally reborn! And now, thou shalt face them!

Futo:
T'was quite a disappointment. It seems the greatest foe to The Path... is not her, after all.

Futo:
T'was a matter of course.
Your popularity with the audience spake volumes.

Reimu:
I get so excited with so many spectators watching.
It just makes me want to be all like pow! and wham!...
Huh? Why am I getting so popular by doing this anyway?

Futo:
I hath not the faintest inkling.

Reimu:
Ugh...
Hate to admit it, but this place has a more festive feel than my shrine.
Well, even away from home, if I can win with style, I should get all the attention!

Byakuren:
I've been expecting you.
I've already defeated all my previous rivals.
Isn't it about time for the climax of this popularity war?

Reimu:
As if I haven't defeated everyone, too! There's no way I can lose here.

Byakuren:
This battle is, in a sense, a surrogate war between Buddhism and Shinto.
I can't say it'll be a complete victory even if one of us bests the other.

Reimu:
I know that.
How we win the hearts of the crowd, and how we gather popularity--
if we earned our victory through dirty tricks, none of that has any meaning.

Byakuren:
I wonder if you can fight with such appeal if you're not used to fighting in front of a crowd.

Byakuren:
Being skilled in danmaku is well and good, but you must train your body more.

Reimu:
I've done it! I've won!
Winning on enemy territory will bring me tons of attention in no time!

Byakuren:
I've lost...? This'll definitely hurt our business.

Reimu:
By the way.
With the crowd getting pumped up, I find myself getting into the fight, too, but...
it's a little strange that everyone's such a big fan of these brawls, y'know.

Byakuren:
Really?
And I thought it was a common occurrence around here.

Reimu:
No, it really isn't.

Miko:
You've made it.

Miko:
So? 
Can you not hear the voice 
of the crowd calling my name?

Reimu:
What's with this... 
this overwhelming discouragement?
Hey.
There were a bunch of people 
on my side up until now, but...
What on earth happened to them?

Miko:
Heh heh heh...
The minds of humans are easily swayed, indeed.
All the faith of those who supported you 
has crumbled in an instant.
Almost like a mirage... 
An apt comparison, no?

Reimu:
Incredible, 
it's like I'm up against the entire audience...
It's hard enough without 
any allies,
but when everyone is on my 
opponent's side, it makes fighting 
that much harder.

Miko:
Ho ho ho!
Now, let us begin. 
This fight shall determine the strongest proselyte in Gensokyo.

Miko:
What a pushover. I haven't even shown my true form.

Reimu:
Huh?
What's this weird feeling?

Miko?:
Ho ho ho! 
I caught you hook, line and sinker.

Reimu:
What?!
They're all tanuki!?

Mamizou:
Ahaha!

Mamizou:
It just little ol' me.

Reimu:
Oh, so I wasn't actually fighting Miko, 
just you disguised as her.
Well, no wonder.
I thought your blows seemed a bit feeble.

Mamizou:
My, my. You're too kind.
So, how about it?
Fancy a round?

Reimu:
No way.
I don't have anything to gain 
from fighting you.

Mamizou:
Don't you now?

Reimu:
Grr...
Well, if there's an audience, 
I just can't run away now, can I?
Even if they are just tanuki.

Mamizou:
Precisely, my child.
Come. Now our fight 
will start for real.
Let the glorious belly-drumming begin.

Mamizou:
Dearie me. Guess I was mistaken.
What if she was actually unrelated to all this...?

Reimu:
Yes! 
I've finally beaten everyone!
Now I will become Gensokyo's most 
popular person.

Mamizou:
...
Has it not come to your attention yet? 
There's another side to this merrymaking...

Reimu:
Huh 
What are you talking about?

Mamizou:
I don't know what the cause is, but...
There's something robbing emotion 
from the humans of Gensokyo.
Not all their emotions, mind you. 
It's just one of them 
that's being sapped away.

Reimu:
Umm...
I got it! 
When I first started... 
I was trying to save the world ruined by pessimism 
with the majesty of the gods...

Mamizou:
Pessimism. 
Indeed.
For the emotion the humans lost...
was none other than hope.
And right now, 
the ones collecting the humans' hope...
...were the lot of you. 
The religious leaders.

Reimu:
See? I knew I was doing the right thing 
after all!

Mamizou:
...You may not realize this,
but right now, in the dead of night around in the Human Village,
it turns into a dreadful place void of emotions.

Reimu:
What?!

Mamizou:
And it's lasting a little longer 
with the passing of each day.
At this rate, it wouldn't shock me 
if they lost all of their emotions forevermore.

Reimu:
So, right about now 
in the Human Village?

Reimu:
I-I can't believe it.
You would never imagine 
there was so much going on during the day.
Everyone seems so lifeless. 
How creepy...
Who's there...?

Reimu:
Who're you?
You don't look like 
a human to me.

???? [Womanly Mask]:
...

Reimu:
What? Are you just 
going to ignore me?

??? [Womanly Mask]:
Did you steal my mask?

Reimu:
?

??? [Old Woman Mask]:
My hope...

??? [Hyottoko Mask]:
Huh, you're different.
It looks like you're filled 
right to the brim with hope! ‚ô™

Reimu:
Huh? Uh... 
Well, of course I am.

??? [Womanly Mask]:
That must mean that you 
have my Mask of Hope...

Reimu:
Hey, 
who are you anyway?

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
I am Hata no Kokoro.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
I control all emotions!

Reimu:
Looks like I've got another 
weird youkai on my hands.

Kokoro„ÄÄ[Womanly Mask]:
I maintain the balance between 
all emotions, such that they are all 
expressed equally.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
I won't allow any emotions to prevail over the rest!

Reimu:
Well, then, 
what do you call this current state of affairs?
Everyone looks so emotionless. It's really eerie.

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
That's because... 
Errr...

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Oh yeah!

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
I have arrived here to solve 
that problem!

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
And I can, now that I've finally found 
a human filled with hope.

Reimu:
Me? 
I guess I am, but so what?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
In order to normalize all emotions 
and return the village to its former self...

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
I must turn you, 
overflowing with hope, 
into my new Mask of Hope!

Reimu:
Wh--
You stupid youkai. 
Now I see what you're after.
You're just 
out to abduct humans, 
aren't you?

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
In place of my lost Mask of Hope, 
a new hope (future) awaits.
I hold no grudge against you.
However, I will claim all 
the hope in Gensokyo! 
For the sake of all human emotion!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
I still need more... 
You do not hold enough hope.

Reimu:
What? You want believers, too?

Marisa:
Well, yeah. I'm not about to let y'all have all the fun.

Reimu:
Then that makes you a rival, too.
I'll beat you here and put you to shame!

Reimu:
You're a bit too weak.

Marisa:
Yeah, I won!
Just you watch!
I'll show you some REAL missionary work.

Marisa:
I bet Reimu and the others only go to places with lots of humans.
A nice, remote place like this oughta be untouched by them.

Nitori:
What are you doing here!?

Marisa:
Just thought I'd put on a little performance 'round these parts.

Nitori:
Hah, I see.
By "performance", do you mean something like this?

Nitori:
Hahaha, you're so lame„Éº

Marisa:
How was that?
I got a little more well-known around here, didn't I?

Nitori:
Ooh... you got me.

Marisa:
In order to capture people's hearts,
you gotta come in from the fringes first.

Marisa:
Yeah, I didn't think there'd be any rivals underground.
Which means I can do my missionary work with no problem.
Wait, how am I gonna do any missionary work if there aren't any enemies around here...?

Koishi:
If you're looking for an enemy, there's one right here.

Marisa:
Huh? I thought I heard something.
Guess it's just my imagination.

Koishi:
Heheheh.
There's an opening!

Koishi:
Maybe I'll go play on the surface again„Éº

Koishi:
Ohhhh, my goodness. I lost...

Marisa:
You surprised me there. Don't sneak up on me without warning like that.
I didn't notice you at all...
Hey, wait, was there any point in you fighting for popularity?
You wouldn't even be able to appeal to the audience, would you?

Koishi:
Hehehe...

Marisa:
I see. Good for you.

Marisa:
This seemed like the natural choice given my streak, but...
Man, this place is really heating up.
And they're all cheering for my enemy, too.

????:
What have we here?

Miko:
Are you participating in this religious war as well?

Marisa:
Well, that's how it turned out.

Miko:
Then I welcome you!
Ah, the appearance of a new rival.

Marisa:
Man, this lack of support is overwhelming.

Miko:
Since you, too, are a proselyte, you should understand the meaning behind this battle.

Marisa:
Naw, I wouldn't call myself that...

Miko:
You won't capture people's hearts with that kind of weak-spirited attitude!
Now, let us have ourselves a lovely battle!
Before all those who are watching!

Miko:
Someone, commiserate for the fallen.

Marisa:
Cool, I won!

Miko:
I've lost. That was some beautiful danmaku.
Can you hear that? Those voices are the praise of the audience.

Marisa:
Whoa!
What a thrill!

Miko:
I had actually planned to become the hope of this world,
but I will concede to you.

Marisa:
Man...
I didn't know getting praised felt this good.
I'll be everyone's hope, and whatever else they want.

Byakuren:
I've been waiting.

Marisa:
So I'm facing you next?
All of Gensokyo is on my side right now.
Doesn't matter who I face, 'cause I'm not gonna lose!

Byakuren:
I wonder about that...
Can't you hear the voices all around you?

Marisa:
Huh?
What? They're all rooting for you!

Byakuren:
Ho ho ho.
How's it feel to lose all your supporters in a flash?

Marisa:
Aw, what the hell.
Now I have to go and get popular all over again.
It's actually kinda...
Exciting!

Byakuren:
You're an interesting one.
Well, it's all good.

Marisa:
If it's just popularity I need...
I can easily get it all back if I win here again!

Byakuren:
Heh, think it'll go that easily?

Byakuren?:
Huh, that was anticlimactic.

Marisa:
Hey, wait a minute!
Just... who are you?
You can't be Hijiri.

Byakuren?:
Ho ho, you finally noticed?
Then there's no point disguising myself anymore.

Marisa:
What?
The audience was all fake, took? I can't believe this...!

Mamizou:
Ahaha!

Mamizou:
It was me, you see.

Marisa:
What?
It was all some bakedanuki's doing, was it? Man, you had me fooled.
Wait, that means that losing my popularity...
Was all faked. That's a relief.

Mamizou:
That's right.
We absolutely love transforming into humans...
So I reckoned I'd give fooling you a shot.

Marisa:
So, the real battle starts now, is that it?

Mamizou:
Oh, you're quick.
And the audience got back pretty quick, too.

Marisa:
Since I'm already here, I guess I'll get popular with the tanuki, too.

Mamizou:
Think it'll be that easy?
You might end up losing your popularity for good this time.

Mamizou:
How weak. No gumption at all.

Marisa:
It's over!
Now I've got support from the tanuki, too!

Mamizou:
...
I wonder.
Don't you think there's something odd going on?

Marisa:
...Whaddaya mean?

Mamizou:
Win a fight and you become toast of the town.
To be more precise, just by punching someone in a fancy way, you gain supporters.
Are humans really like that?

Marisa:
Ah, well...
It happens a lot in Gensokyo anyway, but something is a little weird this time.

Mamizou:
There is only one reason for that.
It means hope itself is missing from Gensokyo.
When people lose hope, they start engaging in momentary pleasures.
You heard them too, right?
The voices saying, "Ain't it all right?"
That's the first step towards ruin.

Marisa:
I see...
So that's why all those religious leaders were so worked up.
They thought their teachings alone could become hope.

Mamizou:
That's right.
And hope was supposed to be the key to saving people from ruin.

Marisa:
Oops. So I guess that even though I won fights and supporters, I still gotta do something with them.

Mamizou:
Now that it's come to this, you just have to give the humans hope.
You may not be aware of this,
but right now, in the dead of night around the Human Village,
it turns into an awful place where emotions don't exist.
You ought to go take a gander before it's too late.

Marisa:
A place where emotions don't... exist?

Marisa:
What... is this?
Are they asleep? No, that's not it.
They're totally lifeless shells.

Marisa:
! Who is it?

???? [Womanly Mask]:
...

Marisa:
Just a blank stare on you, too. What's going on?

???? [Old Woman Mask]:
My hope...

Marisa:
Huh?

???? [Hyottoko Mask]:
Wow, there's a human with hope in a place like this! ‚ô™

???? [Old Man Mask]:
Whew, was I ever worried. I lost my Mask of Hope,
and all the hope disappeared from the village!
Hey, do you understand how I feel right now?

Marisa:
What's with you?
Get so friendly all of a sudden just freaks people out.

???? [Monkey Mask]:
Oops! Excuse me, where are my manners? I am definitely not a suspicious person.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
My name is Hata no Kokoro.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
I'm a menreiki that controls all emotion! ‚ô™

Marisa:
I thought you were expressionless, but your personality is changing a mile a minute.
Is that it, then?
The current state of the village is because you're absorbing all their emotions.
Isn't that right?

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Absorb their emotions?
I'd NEVER do anything like that!

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
I wish for all emotions to be treated equally.

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
But... I can't stand the village in this state...

Marisa:
Hmmm... Just what is going on, then?

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
Err, well...
I sort of lost my Mask of Hope...

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Oh, yes!

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
I have come to solve that problem!
In order to normalize all emotions and return the village to its former self...

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
I should just use you, overflowing with hope, as my new Mask of Hope!

Marisa:
Huh, what's that? You wanna fight me?
You fixing to steal all my hope?
Then, it's on!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
In place of my lost Mask of Hope, a new hope (future) awaits.
I hold no grudge against you.
However, I will claim all the hope in Gensokyo! For the sake of all human emotion!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
I still need more... You do not hold enough hope.

Futo:
I beseech thee!

Futo:
Wager thy temple's signboard upon a duel of honor!

Byakuren:
All right. But I must refuse your conditions.

Futo:
Dost thou intend'st to flee?

Byakuren:
No, I simply don't need your signboard.

Futo:
Should I not attain thy signboard, I shall set it aflame.

Byakuren:
Hmm. Everyone's hearts have turned corrupt.
I must restore morality to all.

Marisa:
What? You wanna fight with a veteran like me?

Byakuren:
Yes. I hold no grudge against you, but...
I would like to spread the importance of the teachings of Buddhism to everyone.
And conveniently, we have here an expendable character who won't be defeated too easily.

Marisa:
Wh--
Who you callin' "expendable"? I'll show ya!
I'd rather lose in no time flat!

Marisa:
Not even worth braggin' about at a drinkin' party. I don't think you even do drink.

Byakuren:
The first thing to do is to grasp the hearts of the people.

Marisa:
Crap. I sure got egg on my face.

Byakuren:
It's okay.
There's no shame to be had in losing to me.

Reimu:
The boss herself is marching into enemy territory.
You must be pretty confident, huh?

Reimu:
That, or just stupid.

Byakuren:
I don't expect that our organized Buddhism will lose out to a primitive religion,
but apparently this archaic Shinto is what's gathering the most faith in Gensokyo,
so I must defeat it no matter what.
Although it's... just incidental.

Reimu:
If you disrespect the gods' power, you'll be cursed!

Reimu:
Now, receive a myriad of curses!

Byakuren:
The gods' power, you say? But you're not a god.

Reimu:
I couldn't hear any voices today, that's all.

Byakuren:
I wonder if this will make this delinquent shrine a little more quiet.

Miko:
You've arrived!

Miko:
You want to determine the strongest practitioner on my own territory, do you?

Byakuren:
Yes.
Regardless of these conditions, I thought I'd have to settle things eventually.
With you, and your evil spells.

Miko:
How utterly absurd!
To me, your religion, which only serves to control humans, is far more evil!

Miko:
I am the only one who can save the humans now.

Byakuren:
Everything is a wink of a dream. Hail, hail to the three treasures.
Things such as immortality may all be just a fraud.

Miko:
I lost. What amazing martial arts.
Have you noticed the people's blighted hearts yet?

Byakuren:
Yes, of course. I'm fighting now in order to save their souls.

Miko:
It's vexing, but...
I will yield that role to you.

Byakuren:
Oh, what's wrong?

Reimu:
How's about I ask you for another go-round?

Byakuren:
Again...? The popularity battle has already ended.
You don't want to get embarrassed even further, do you?

Reimu:
Don't be so hasty now.
Y'see? Look at the audience.

Byakuren:
?!
What is going on? Everyone is cheering for you?

Reimu:
That's right. You've got no more allies now.

Byakuren:
I simply must get you to tell me what is going on.

Reimu:
How about I give you a nice purification? There ya go.

Byakuren:
Hmhmhm.
I thought something was odd. So that's what's going on?

Reimu?:
Oh, so you've noticed.
Guess I don't need this form any longer, then.

Byakuren:
That was a remarkable transformation.

Mamizou:
Ahaha!

Mamizou:
I caught you hook, line and sinker.

Byakuren:
I absolutely couldn't tell you apart from the real thing.
What a terrifying transformation ability...

Mamizou:
Thank you, thank you.

Byakuren:
Although, for a moment, it felt like Miss Reimu had gotten older.

Mamizou:
Now, how about we start the battle anew.

Byakuren:
I thought I had gathered most of the popularity in Gensokyo,
but I never thought there were this many unfaithful tanuki!

Mamizou:
Now I'm the head priest 'round here.

Mamizou:
I give!
Any more and I'll feel it tomorrow.

Byakuren:
I don't want to do any unnecessary killing.
As long as I can save the hearts of the people, I will be content.

Mamizou:
......
The hearts of people, huh? Can you really save them?

Byakuren:
...What do you mean?

Mamizou:
Don't you know?
Right now, in the dead of night, the Human Village,
turns into a dreadful place void of emotions.
There are humans who have no feelings at all, let alone hope.

Byakuren:
A place without emotion?
No matter how much hope they have lost, I can't imagine them losing all their emotions.
Perhaps... there is someone behind everything
who is causing the people's hearts to harden?

Byakuren:
I can't believe it...
You'd never think that it was so lively during the day.
I can't sense any feelings at all.

Byakuren:
Who are you?

??? [Womanly Mask]:
......

Byakuren:
You aren't human.

??? [Old Woman Mask]:
My hope...

Byakuren:
?

??? [Hannya Mask]:
Where did you take my Mask of Hope!?

Byakuren:
M-Mask of Hope? Er, well, I don't really know......

??? [Monkey Mask]:
Oh, uh, someone's here? Apologies. Who are you?

Byakuren:
I am Byakuren Hijiri.
I am a monk of the Myouren Temple... And you are?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
My name is Hata no Kokoro.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
I am the one who controls all emotions!

Byakuren:
Emotions... you say?
Therefore, the village's current state is...

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
...My Mask of Hope was lost, and so the emotions are... out of control.

Byakuren:
Mask?
It seems your masks aren't just for decoration.
So you're saying that, because the mask that controls hope was lost, the humans' hearts turned depraved...?

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Exactly correct!

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
So, I'm asking you, where did my Mask of Hope go?!

Byakuren:
How am I supposed to know such a thing?

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
So you say, but I know.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
You alone have maintained hope in this world where emotions have gone out of control.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
You must be the one who stole my Mask of Hope!

Byakuren:
In Buddhism, there is a precept that prohibits stealing.
I certainly can't abide someone accusing me of being a thief.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
And I'm supposed to believe you?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Could you kindly give it back to me?

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
My emotions are also out of control, so I'm in trouble too...
If this continues... all emotions will be lost from Gensokyo...

Byakuren:
......
I've certainly never committed thievery,
but I can never abandon a youkai in need, either.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Give my hope back already, you dastard!

Byakuren:
I'm going to save you, but first I'll need to have you calm down!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Hope has to be be managed evenly, by my hand!
Now, return to me! My hope...
No, the hope of every human being!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Your weakness is hopeless...

Reimu:
I'll accept your challenge!

Reimu:
Whose religion is more popular? Our duel will decide!

Miko:
Might makes right.
If that is the way of Gensokyo, the decision will be a simple one!

Reimu:
No religion is better than Shinto!

Miko:
Excellent.
For the sake of those who admire me, I cannot lose.

Marisa:
Looks like you beat Reimu.

Marisa:
Now I get a chance at you!

Miko:
I do not wish to be seen bullying the weak. If you are confident, however,
I see no reason to refuse.

Marisa:
Alright!
If I beat you, that means I beat Reimu, too!

Marisa:
Maybe I should start up a religion myself?

Miko:
Come, worship me!

Marisa:
Well, long as your usin' it for good.

Miko:
The strength of faith is something different from yours.

Ichirin:
Nice to meet you, I guess?

Ichirin:
I've been wondering what your ancient power is like. So you're going to show me.

Miko:
"Buddhism does not condone violence." At least, I've heard as much.

Ichirin:
Violence against heretics is something that's always condoned!

Ichirin:
A religion that makes immortality its doctrine can't be anything but heretical.

Miko:
Go chant your Buddhist prayers or whatever else for the deceased.
There's no need for religions that only see losers from the beginning.

Byakuren:
So you've finally come.

Byakuren:
It seems that you took care of my pupil earlier.

Miko:
What they call Buddhism has become, as I expected, a two-faced religion.
Despite the strict self-discipline and unadorned clothing,
in truth, they unabashedly vie for political power!

Byakuren:
Hmph.
It's a pity how a monk and a Taoist can see the same thing so differently.

Byakuren:
Hail to Amitabha.

Miko:
Humans cannot gain strength through scripture alone.
Your lack of training is your downfall!

Byakuren:
With this... the hearts of Gensokyo are now yours.

Miko:
You can entrust them to me.
For they will be returned soon enough!

Miko:
Now that those troublesome religions have been eliminated, everything should be in order.
All that is left is for me to return hope to the village myself.
Though I feel such a method is a bit too simple.

Miko:
How!? What deception is this?

Miko?:
Ho ho ho...

Miko?:
There's still a proselyte you haven't fought.

Miko:
....How very bizarre this is.

Miko?:
How about a match with me?

Miko:
How you are imitating me, I do not know.
But you cannot possibly mimic my technique, as well!

Miko?:
What a shame. Looks like my technique was better.

Miko:
The game is over!
I would not use such wicked arts!
Show yourself, impostor!

Mamizou:
What did you think about my little youkai technique?

Miko:
I see. So this was a bake-danuki's doing.

Mamizou:
Well? Having seen me pose as you and then lose your cool, what will you do?
All that faith you've painstakingly collected, gone in an instant...

Miko:
Why you...!

Mamizou:
Religion is nothing more than a tower built on sand.
It's something like a mirage.

Miko:
Oh-ho. Do you want to anger me?

Mamizou:
They've all caught the scent of battle and come to watch.

Miko:
I will ensure you can never mimic me again!

Mamizou:
All righty then. Who'll I transform into tomorrow?

Mamizou:
I give!
Any more and I'll feel it tomorrow.

Miko:
Hmph. Make sure you never do anything as ridiculous as imitating me again.

Mamizou:
Whaaat?
I was just testing your resolve a bit. Don't get so mad.

Miko:
What was that?

Mamizou:
Don't you know?
Right now, in the dead of night, the Human Village,
turns into a dreadful place void of emotions.
There are humans who have no feelings at all, let alone hope.

Miko:
No emotions whatsoever?

Mamizou:
That's what I wanted to tell you, since you would only look during the day.

Miko:
I see.
If there is any other information that I do not know, tell me at once.
Also, let us forget my earlier impoliteness.

Mamizou:
I'll think about it...

Miko:
Indeed. It is just as that bake-danuki said.
One would never imagine this being the same town that was clamoring over duels in the day.
Perhaps this will not be as simple as I had predicted...

Miko:
Who are you?

??? [Womanly Mask]:
......

Miko:
You are....

??? [Old Woman Mask]:
My Mask of Hope...

Miko:
Those masks... I've seen them before.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
What was that?

Miko:
Those are Hata no Kawakatsu's masks, are they not?
Did they become tsukumogami over the years?

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
You! From the way you speak... Do you know where the Mask of Hope is?

Miko:
Mask of Hope? I know not of such a thing.
...Aha. I believe I understand now.
Superior articles summon not just people, but spirits as well.
After being left alone for so many years, Kawakatsu's masks turned into a youkai that can control people's hearts.

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
...Turned into a youkai?

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Yes, I became a youkai! You know well.

Miko:
How pitiful such objects are. You don't even possess your own emotions.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
No, no.

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
One of the masks is missing right now, so the emotions going berserk, is all.

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
My true self... can manage emotion more freely...

Miko:
A mask you lost... would that be the Mask of Hope?

Miko:
......
Very well. I will make you a new Mask of Hope.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
What?

Miko:
For I was the one who originally created Kawakatsu's masks, you see.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Huh? What?

Miko:
But before that, I must defeat you, who the masks are attached to.
With your emotions running wild, I imagine you are also troubled.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Just quit nitpicking and make me another Mask of Hope!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
If you do not, all emotion from this human village will be lost,
forever!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
That way lies the finish line of despair!

Ichirin:
I have to protect the temple while Lady Hijiri is away.

Marisa:
Yo! Anyone home?

Ichirin:
What do you need?

Marisa:
You've got some some nerve for what you pulled earlier!
This time I won't lose!

Marisa:
Well, that made me feel better.

Ichirin:
What do you mean by "this time"?

Marisa:
I got beat by your head priest.
Thought I'd come over an' get some payback.

Ichirin:
Just what is she doing...?
Maybe I should go and see for myself.

Ichirin:
Greetings!

Reimu:
Oh. It's the stubborn old man.

Ichirin:
Did Lady Hijiri come by here?

Reimu:
Hijiri? Ah, she dropped by earlier.

Ichirin:
So I was right?

Reimu:
Ahh, just remembering it ticks me off.
I know! I can beat you, and recover a bit of my popularity!

Reimu:
Whew, that was refreshing.

Ichirin:
So that's it. Lady Hijiri has been dueling...

Reimu:
Well, we're calling them duels, but they're more like mock battles.
The current situation is critical for us religious leaders.
And here I thought I might be able to cancel out my loss by beating you...

Ichirin:
I see. So, if I were to lose, all our achievements would come to nothing?
I might be weak but I'd like to help her. ...Maybe as long as I don't get in the way.

Nitori:
Huuuuh? What business does a priest have here?

Ichirin:
I hear the youkai living in this ravine lack morals.
I'm here to instruct them about Buddha's teachings.

Nitori:
We don't like religious solicitors.
These days, things like Buddha and morals just seem ludicrous.

Ichirin:
I suppose I have no choice but to persuade you by force.

Nitori:
A religion that goes around soliciting can't be any good.

Ichirin:
The Myouren Temple has been open to youkai from the start.
You're welcome to join any time. You'd make lots of friends, too.

Ichirin:
So I've returned here.
To us, the underground is the land of our disgrace.

Koishi:
Oh, who might you be?

Ichirin:
But, if we just avert our eyes, the underground youkai will go unsaved.

Koishi:
Ah! It's an old Mikoshi-nyuudou.

Ichirin:
Now, let's see if there are any opponents handy for my underground missionary work?

Koishi:
Is everyone ignoring me?

Ichirin:
Huh? Unzan, did you say something?
There's someone right in front of me? Don't be silly.

Koishi:
You big dummy.

Koishi:
That wasn't satisfying.

Ichirin:
I didn't notice her at all.
Could this perhaps be the Buddhist state of selflessness?

Koishi:
Yikes, the old nyuudou sure was strong.
I thought you'd been corrupted by the big city and become a playboy.

Ichirin:
There's no big city on the surface either. Not at all.

Ichirin:
That concludes my missionary work for today.
I probably managed to reach those in places where Lady Hijiri didn't go in particular.

Byakuren:
Hey, what are you doing?

Ichirin:
Ah, Lady Hijiri.

Byakuren:
I told you to watch Myouren Temple while I was out, didn't I?
But you still decided to sneak out.

Ichirin:
My apologies. A strange guest showed up.

Byakuren:
No! This is unforgivable. Unforgivable, I say!
Thanks to you, the Myouren Temple's in utter shambles.

Ichirin:
What did you say?

Byakuren:
Mm-hmmm.
Thanks to you flying the coop, it's in shambles. Shambles, I say!

Ichirin:
We must return immediately!

Byakuren:
You're not getting away!

Byakuren:
Ho ho ho. You're in shambles! Shambles, I say.

Ichirin:
Wait a moment!
None of our Buddhists use wicked arts like that!
Who are you?

Mamizou:
Guess you found me ooouuuuut?

Ichirin:
Why, you! Tricking people like that,
and even worse, pretending to be Lady Hijiri!
I won't let you get away with this!
Prepare yourself!

Mamizou:
Ho ho ho. If things continued as they were, it'd just be so dull.

Mamizou:
So, since we've also got an audience now,
Let's get down to business!

Mamizou:
Go on, have a drink.
You dirty, rotten priest.

Mamizou:
I give! You've won this one.

Ichirin:
I couldn't lose to a bake-danuki.

Mamizou:
If it were a full moon tonight, you'd be in for a bit of a surprise.

Ichirin:
That incredible transformation power was quite surprising enough.

Mamizou:
You've got another surprise coming, then...
After this, you oughta head to the Human Village.
There's something even more surprising there.

Ichirin:
?
But as a youkai, I've been instructed not to enter the village if I can help it...

Mamizou:
Whaat? Aw, don't worry your pretty little head.
No one'll see you at this hour.

Ichirin:
Sigh*

Mamizou:
Well, it's about time for us old folks to part ways.
Next time, I'd like to have myself a transform-off with that youngster.

Ichirin:
By that, did you mean Unzan?

Ichirin:
What is this?
I can't feel any sign of human life.
Is this what the bake-danuki wanted to show me?

Ichirin:
Who are you?

??? [Womanly Mask]:
...

??? [Old Woman Mask]:
My Mask of Hope...

Ichirin:
I've never seen you before!

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Where is my Mask of Hope!?

Ichirin:
Heh, I get it.
What the bake-danuki wanted me to see was this mask performance!

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Oh, you're going to watch my Noh play?

Ichirin:
Of course I will!
But, I can't ignore the strange things going on here.

Ichirin:
Perhaps Lady Hijiri went to fix this situation, and she...

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
So you're not going to watch?

Ichirin:
I have to restore these people's hearts first.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Watch it! Right now!

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
And let your emotions explode!

Ichirin:
Explode my emotions? I've trained so I won't lose my calm!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Will you be able to say the same once you've witnessed my arcane Noh of Darkness (Monkey Possession) ?

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Weak. Much too weak.

Futo:
Mayhaps the shrine maiden doth be present?
As I presume she hath presently dueled the Crown Prince,
I judged an explanation to be necessary and thus drew hither.

Marisa:
If you're goin' on about Reimu, she's gotten all sour.

Futo:
Oh? Wherefore would that be?

Marisa:
Well, that'd be since she lost to your boss.
I was thinkin' I'd set out and get her some restitution.
That is, by beatin' up some of Miko's lackeys.

Futo:
Hoh. That, I cannot overlook.

Marisa:
I'm comin' for you next, Miko.

Marisa:
Crap.
Even if I can't beat her, if I can take down her boss...

Futo:
One who cannot best me wouldst never vanquish the Crown Prince.

Futo:
It came to mine ears that the Crown Prince doth battled here.
Yet, whom did she confront?
I beg a moment of thy time. 'Twas a recent engagement hereabouts?

Koishi:
Are you talking to me?

Futo:
Most certainly. Who else wouldst thou believe is present?

Koishi:
You're right. Of course.

Futo:
Concerning the recent engagement, who dost struggle against the Crown Prince?

Koishi:
Forget about that and fight with me, okay?

Futo:
Fie. I chose the wrong personage with whom to speak.

Koishi:
I do this, and I get more popular, huh?

Futo:
I see. Lady Marisa was the opponent.
What a nimble girl.
No further explanation wouldst be necessary.

Koishi:
Aww, nobody noticed our match, did they?

Futo:
That's not it.
Has not everyone been supporting us subconsciously?

Ichirin:
Back again?
Taoism is as persistent as it is reprehensible.

Futo:
Hold. Afford me an explanation.
As you are undoubtedly aware, the hearts of humanity doth be crying out!
Now is hardly the time to rely upon the liberty of choosing religions.
If only temporarily, we must unite our faiths together and restore their hearts.

Ichirin:
That matter is being dealt with by Lady Hijiri.
We can leave it all to Buddhism, heathen.

Futo:
Must we remain at odds...?

Ichirin:
What? That was so weak.

Futo:
Such splendid physical technique thou hast displayed.
Those bewitching arts scarce belong at the side of Buddhism.
Wouldst thou consider converting?

Ichirin:
I will not turn my back on Buddhism anymore.

Futo:
Thou can partake of sake as well.

Futo:
'Twould appear the Prince hath already brought events to their conclusion.
Though without regard to creed, Buddhism and I have a profound connection.
It moveth me most deeply.
...It may even alight a fire.

???:
Move it!

Nitori:
Hey, you're in the way! I'm taking apart my stall.

Futo:
Oh, pray pardon.
And it appeaseth so, regarding the earlier match between the Crown Prince and the head priest,
Mightst thou kindly recount for me the particulars?

Nitori:
Huh?
I don't give a flip how these matches are going.
Compared to these religions struggling for the top spot,
my stall is much more important to me.
I gotta earn back the equipment rental fee, after all!

Futo:
My word.
Was the Crown Prince completely unable to seize thine heart?
I may be weak, but I will assist in the missionary work.

Nitori:
This crowbar-like object of mine is breathing fire!

Futo:
How didst thou find these beautiful maneuvers?

Nitori:
Ohh, so this is the power of religion...

Futo:
My religion refuseth not even youkai.

Nitori:
I see. You need a flexible way of thinking to come up with interesting ideas, huh...

Futo:
Indeed.

Nitori:
But I might as well go with Shinto.
Next time I'll go to the shrine.

Futo:
What farce is this!?

Futo:
Oh, hast it grown this late?
The Crown Prince hath surely finished by now.
The main event is tomorrow.

Miko:
Hey, what are you doing?

Futo:
Ah, Crown Prince.

Miko:
What are doing, fiddling around in a place like this?

Futo:
Eh? Ah, I was conveying to all the reasons that we duel.

Miko:
Oh? Did I ask you you do that?

Futo:
Indeed. For one to fight in earnest, one must first declare their intentions.

Miko:
I see, I see.
I have to give a reason before the duel, eh...?
That's easy!

Miko:
Wow, you're so shrimpy.

Futo:
Hold.
Something is quite odd.

Miko:
What's wrong? Giving up?
Wasn't your master stronger than this?

Futo:
What? Explaineth thyself.

Miko:
Ho ho ho.

Futo:
Th-thou eel-skinned knave.
This was the work of a bake-danuki!?

Mamizou:
You were easily fooled.
Now do you understand why popularity is so meaningless?

Futo:
You knave! Have you...?

Mamizou:
That's right. All your accumulated popularity, gone 'cause of a mean ol' imposter.
Religion is honestly no different from a mirage.

Futo:
Thine deception shan't be forgiven.
By and large, transforming with such ill intent is just thy one-sided evil, is it not?

Mamizou:
Ho ho ho. Looks like everyone followed the scent of battle.

Futo:
I shall render thee unable to reproduce such vile transformation!

Mamizou:
If this is all she can do, I don't even feel like transforming.

Mamizou:
I give, I give! You've won.
Sorry for provoking you.
I wasn't exactly being mean.

Futo:
And thou mentionst it, didst not thou say:
"Wasn't your master stronger than THIS?"
Perchance thou fought the Crown Prince?

Mamizou:
What's with that horrible imitation of me?

Futo:
Scoff not at mine imitation. So, thou hast fought, correct?

Mamizou:
Yup, that's right.

Futo:
Wherefore? What scheme dost thou work?

Mamizou:
I'm also worried about the humans' ruined hearts.
I'm digging around to see if something's going on behind everything.
You should try following her, too.
It might even have been resolved already.

Futo:
Hm?

Futo:
What spectacle is this...?
Doth something occur beyond my notice?

Futo:
Who might thou be?

??? [Womanly Mask]:
...

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
Hooray! I'm going to get a new mask of hope!

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
With this, everyone in the village, and even I, will be saved.

Futo:
Dost thou spare a moment?
Hast thou sighted the Crown Prince hereabouts?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
But... when will that be?

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
What should I do until then...?

Futo:
Marry, dost thou listen?
Have I chosen the wrong personage with whom to speakth once again?

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
You... you have the same smell as that god from before!

Futo:
God?
Well, if thou meanst the Crown Prince, 'tis an understandable error.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Um, what are you going on about?

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Just give me the Mask of Hope! Quickly!

Futo:
Alas. Mine fortune in conversing hast been poor of late.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
I haven't had enough yet!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
I should make all of your emotions explode, too!
Take this! My arcane Noh of Darkness (Monkey Possession) !

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
Not yet, not yet„Éº I don't have the Mask of Hope yet„Éº

Nitori:
Another profitable day.
Festivals really rake in the dough.

Byakuren:
Excuse me...

Nitori:
Hm?

Byakuren:
I wanted to talk to you about the stall you've set up.
You see, we've been getting complaints that one of the stall-keepers is swindling customers...

Nitori:
If they let themselves get scammed by some stall that's their own fault.

Byakuren:
All the same, we certainly can't overlook this.

Byakuren:
It feels a bit emptier around here now.

Nitori:
Would you get out of my hair?
I pay my business fee and everything, so quit complaining already.

Byakuren:
Well, we seem to have attracted an audience, so I suppose I can turn a blind eye for now...

Nitori:
Now then, guess I'll go pick some cucumbers.

??:
Wait!

Ichirin:
Why did you resort to such violence at the temple?

Nitori:
Hey, she's the one who started it, isn't she?

Ichirin:
You've been doing something evil once again, I see.
Accept this punishment, amoral water youkai!

Ichirin:
Take that! Punishing people is exciting.

Nitori:
Every one of you religious guys just spouts nothing but nonsense.
Stop fighting and preaching and getting people riled up just to get what you want.

Ichirin:
You are quite mistaken about religion.

Nitori:
Hmph.

Nitori:
Fish sell well at festivals.
If I can get a monopoly on the humans' fishing rights, it'll be easy money!

Marisa:
It's you, isn't it?
The kappa who's been goin' around winnin' peoples' hearts for some reason?

Nitori:
Huh? Their hearts?

Marisa:
You wanna put 'em up for bets? Let's brawl.

Nitori:
Why in the world would we do something so stupid? We've got nothing to do with religion.

Marisa:
You don't get it.
We've been neck-deep in this for a while now... both you and me.

Marisa:
Also, don't go monopolizin' any fishing rights.

Nitori:
What a pain.
It's not like I'm fighting because I want to be popular.

Marisa:
You're always relyin' on your tools, aren'tcha?
Them gadgets are basically a religion, and the tricks for using 'em are the dogma.
In other words, t' other people you don't look too different from a religious type.

Nitori:
If you start saying that, then everyone's a believer in something.

Marisa:
Bit late for that, isn't it?

Nitori:
Now then, let's branch out the business.
A lot of things happen in this kind of atmosphere.
Hey~! Miss Reimu!
What do you say to setting my stand up at your shrine and making some money~?

Reimu:
No.

Nitori:
Eh? Why not~?

Reimu:
We're in the middle of a battle for popularity.
Joining up with a youkai racketeer like you would be suicide.

Nitori:
That's some worthless popularity, if you can lose it just like that.
If that's the best your religion can do, you should probably just give up.

Reimu:
Human hearts change easily.
Well, maybe you wouldn't understand that.

Nitori:
If they're that hard to hold onto, then I suppose you won't mind losing them.
Popularity like that, honestly!

Reimu:
Thank you very kindly for aiding in our missionary work.

Nitori:
Wait, could this cheering be...?

Reimu:
There's no "could" about it; they're cheering for you.

Nitori:
Seriously? I didn't mean to do that.
I really am neck-deep in this whole contest after all, huh.

Reimu:
So, what do you plan to do with all this popularity?

Nitori:
Well,
I figure it could help with the business.

Nitori:
Profits from the Myouren Temple have been going down.
Maybe the audience is going down, too?

Miko:
You there! The kappa youngster.

Miko:
What do you reckon on doing with all the attention you've gathered?

Nitori:
Unfortunately, it looks like people are paying less attention to the duels lately... ...wait.
Who're you?

Miko:
I'm the strongest religious leader around!
Don't think you could conquer this festival without taking me down.

Nitori:
I dunno about that. Who cares about being the strongest leader?
You stink.
You stink like some beast worse than a tanuki!

Miko:
I'm not worse than a tanuki. I'm not.

Miko?:
Ho ho ho.
Not bad for a youngster.

Nitori:
Don't call me a youngster.

Miko?:
Time for me to get serious.

Nitori:
So it was a tanuki after all, eh?
Why'd you transform into some big-shot religious leader?

Mamizou:
My question is, rather, why is a lone youkai like you...

Mamizou:
...competing for popularity, I wonder?

Nitori:
It was an accident. I've been trying to pull out! Really!

Mamizou:
I see. You wanted to pull out.
To pull out everyone's shirikodama, hmmm?

Nitori:
What?

Mamizou:
If even a nonreligious youkai could get this far,
then I might have a chance too.

Mamizou:
Sorry, that was an accident. I tried to pull out and all.

Mamizou:
I give, I give! You're strong.
Or maybe just popular.

Nitori:
Are you saying there's some connection between strength and popularity?

Mamizou:
A big one. Especially now.

Nitori:
?

Mamizou:
I was actually hoping to resolve this mess by having someone be a sacrifice,
but instead I get this faithless kappa.
I suppose interesting things do happen.

Nitori:
What are you talking about?

Mamizou:
You should go check out the village while it's still night out.
Seeing as you're actually the strongest leader right now.

Nitori:
What is this?
I can take as many shirikodama as I like.

Nitori:
What the?

??? [Womanly Mask]:
...

??? [Old Woman Mask]:
My Mask of Hope...

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Where is my Mask of Hope?!

Nitori:
I dunno.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
I've got to recover my Mask of Hope soon...

Nitori:
Mask of Hope?
Ah, now that you mention it, we sell a whole lot of masks at the stall.
You might find what you're looking for in there.
See anything?

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
What!? The Mask of Hope is in your stall?

Nitori:
Wanna check it out?

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
I wanna, I wanna~

Nitori:
Okay, then fork over some money.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
You want money?

Nitori:
Obviously? I'm not running a charity here.

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
Scary... this person is scary.

Nitori:
So do you need it or not?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Hold on, let me think this through.
In the first place...

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
In the first place, wasn't the Mask of Hope MINE?!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
What am I afraid of?
I can just kill her and take it back! That is my hope!

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
What's with these toy masks?

Koishi:
Wow, everyone looks so cool.
I wanna fight too.

Miko:
Oh? Seems you're not human.

Miko:
The way you erase your presence... you're no ordinary person.

Koishi:
Heeey~ I wanna fight too„Éº

Miko:
I've just finished a battle, but...
Well, I certainly don't mind.

Koishi:
Yay„Éº

Miko:
Worship me!

Koishi:
Did I look cool, too?

Miko:
To think that I can't read her mind...

Futo:
The Crown Prince hath been defeated by someone, you say?
And the opponent is unknown... What is going on?

Koishi:
Hellooo~?
Could you please fight with me?

Futo:
Muh-- where is that voice coming from?

Koishi:
Can't she see me?
Take this!

Futo:
How very surprising. What was that?

Koishi:
Yay„Éº That was fun„Éº

Futo:
'Tis like brushing a curtain aside, and yet...
Why am I the one who has lost?

Koishi:
I could get addicted to this.

Koishi:
So, who am I gonna fight next?

Marisa:
Hey, you over there!

Marisa:
Let's have a match.

Koishi:
Eh? You noticed me?

Marisa:
What do you mean?

Koishi:
Almost nobody has ever called out to me before.

Marisa:
I see.
Lately, though, you've been gettin' pretty famous as this new force who defeated the Taoist crew.
Of course, I'm gonna be the one to defeat you here.

Marisa:
Fightin' with you was pretty tough.

Koishi:
I ended up winning again.
What's this? Something doesn't feel right.
Everyone's looking at me?

Marisa:
Well, yeah. Ya win a duel, and ya attract attention.

Koishi:
Yay„Éº This feels great„Éº

Koishi:
I wonder if my next opponent isn't here~?
Even moving is embarrassing when everyone's watching.

Ichirin:
Are you that youkai who everyone's had their eye on recently?

Koishi:
That's right~

Ichirin:
I've heard you rose to the top without anyone noticing.
It's impressive how you can suppress such an impressive presence.
However, I hear that recently you've been having wicked thoughts.
How unfortunate.

Koishi:
Wicked thoughts~?
I don't really get it, but you're my next opponent!
I wanna win and get even more attention!

Ichirin:
It's rather hard to attain selflessness in the end, hm...?

Koishi:
Yay, I won again~
At this rate, I bet everyone will start talking to me.

Ichirin:
Far from talking to you...
Everyone's going to be influenced by you, aren't they?

Koishi:
They'll do whatever I order them to, huh~
I wonder if I'll be able to move my own body around freely, too?

Koishi:
Who would be a good next opponent~?

Reimu:
Hoh hoh hoh.

Reimu:
How about fightin' me?

Koishi:
This is great! Opponents just keep on coming.

Reimu:
You'd be willing to duel me?

Koishi:
Hoh hoh hoh Ab-so-lute-ly.

Reimu:
Sh-she's mimicking me!?

Reimu:
The nail that sticks up will start to rot.

Reimu:
Not bad.
I might have to get serious.

Koishi:
Is it over already?

Reimu:
We'll see about that.

Koishi:
Okay! After the shrine maiden, you're next!

Mamizou:
Er, yeah.

Koishi:
I'll win this time, too!

Mamizou:
What the? It's not worth tricking her at all.
What does she see with those eyes?

Koishi:
What's wrong? Lost your nerve?

Mamizou:
No way, no way.

Mamizou:
Now then, this is the real thing.
This won't turn out like it did with that shrine maiden.

Mamizou:
I won't lose to some mysterious youkai.

Mamizou:
That's a match!
There's tomorrow, too, so let's call it a day.

Koishi:
Yay, I won again!
Who's my next opponent~?

Mamizou:
You sure are tough. You don't ever get tired, do you?

Koishi:
Tired? I've never been aware of that~

Mamizou:
What a mysterious person.
I can't feel any emotion from you other than what's on the surface.

Koishi:
Ehehe~ It's fun, though!

Mamizou:
I'm not sure about that either.
However,
it's different from the humans in the village, who can't feel anything.
It seems like you're overflowing wonderfully with hope...

Koishi:
Is my next opponent going to be here~?
Huh? It's so quiet.
Is this what they call 'the dead of night'?

??? [Womanly Mask]:
...

??? [Old Woman Mask]:
My Mask of Hope...

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Where is my Mask of Hope!?

Koishi:
Yay„Éº It's my next opponent~

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
I've got to recover my Mask of Hope soon...

Koishi:
Mask of Hope?
Ah~
I've seen a mask like yours before~

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
What was that?

Koishi:
This pure white mask fell through a crack in the earth~
It was creepy, so I remember it really well~

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
What!? What sort of expression was on that mask?

Koishi:
It was a child's pure-white face.
It reminded me of a Jizo statue, somehow...

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
That... that's got to be my Mask of Hope!

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Where exactly is it now?

Koishi:
That's a secret.
It's already my treasure.
...wait, huh? I always forget everything...

Koishi:
...so why do I remember just this one thing?

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Why, you...!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
So you're saying you won't return the Mask of Hope?

Koishi:
Yep. I don't want to give it back.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
If you only have a one-sided mask, your emotions are going to break down,

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
At this rate, even your emotions are going to go berserk!

Koishi:
No problem.
I haven't got any emotions on me to begin with.

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
How pitiful! In order to prevent you from becoming like me, I'm going to take the Mask of Hope from you right now!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Where? Where is my Mask of Hope?

Mamizou:
Hey. So, how is it?

Ichirin:
How is what?

Mamizou:
You know, the thing with the Menreiki.

Ichirin:
Menreiki... Ah, you mean Miss Kokoro.
About that...

Mamizou:
Hold on.
Let's continue this after our duel.

Ichirin:
What? Why?

Ichirin:
Why'd you lose?

Mamizou:
We have to live up to the audience's expectations, you see.
We can't just not fight.

Ichirin:
Well, you've gotten into the habit of fighting.
So, about Miss Kokoro...

Futo:
Oh, it art thou...?

Mamizou:
So, I wanna know what happened after all that.

Futo:
What is... "that"?

Mamizou:
The thing with the Menreiki.

Futo:
Ah. That?
However, there is something we must do first, correct?

Mamizou:
No problem.

Futo:
About the Menreiki...

Futo:
You are strong.

Mamizou:
Aw, c'mon, I was holding back.

Futo:
About the Menreiki...
The Crown Prince granted her a new Mask of Hope.
The tsukumogami should be turning back into the original tools around now.

Mamizou:
Hmm...?
Well, this doesn't match the story I heard from that monk.

Mamizou:
Now then, let's hear what the priest has to say.

Byakuren:
Oh, it's you.

Mamizou:
So how is it going?

Byakuren:
We've had an adequate increase in followers.

Mamizou:
No, I mean what happened with the Menreiki...

Byakuren:
Ah yes, about her...
Oh my, the crowd is calling "Get on with it already"?

Mamizou:
It's tough, being so popular.

Byakuren:
Well, it's nice to hear that.

Byakuren:
It's tough having so many fans looking forward to duels.

Mamizou:
Eh, I don't mind it myself.

Byakuren:
Miss Kokoro has been coming to the temple to train recently.

Mamizou:
Train, you say?

Byakuren:
The festive atmosphere should calm down soon, too.

Mamizou:
Hmm. This doesn't add up.

Mamizou:
Is this where she is?
The one who made the new Mask of Hope.

Miko:
Oh, it's the old lady from earlier.

Mamizou:
Ol- old lady?

Miko:
Did you come to settle things?

Mamizou:
I came to ask about the Menreiki, but...
This heat... I suppose we can't not fight.

Miko:
Indeed, I knew you'd understand!

Miko:
In time, this festive atmosphere shall be over as well.

Miko:
About the Menreiki, huh?
It's all okay now, since I made a new Mask of Hope.

Mamizou:
Is that so?

Miko:
Does something trouble you? You can say it.

Mamizou:
It seems the Menreiki has been training at the temple.

Miko:
Eh, what? The temple?

Mamizou:
Would that be because there's a period of time before the mask restores her hope?

Miko:
I... suppose so.

Mamizou:
Might as well ask her too.
She's supposed to be religious, I guess.

Reimu:
What? You want to hear about the Menreiki?
Kokoro drops by the shrine pretty often.

Mamizou:
Oh? What for?

Reimu:
Aw, geez, the crowd's getting noisy.
Hold on a second while I shut them up.
I don't feel like having a duel today--!

Mamizou:
Hang on.

Reimu:
What? Why'd you stop me?

Mamizou:
Hoh hoh hoh, don't finish that thought.
Of course we're going to duel, right?

Reimu:
If you're looking for Kokoro, she's over there...

Mamizou:
You didn't hold back, did you?
Everyone else just pretended to fight, you know?

Reimu:
Really? I thought I was holding back.

Mamizou:
So, you said the Menreiki comes to the shrine?

Reimu:
Yeah, yeah, she's always coming over.
So she can look for the Mask of Hope.

Mamizou:
What was that? She's looking for the mask?
What could this mean?

Reimu:
Ah, look, she came today too.
Checking to see if it's mixed in with the stalls' masks...

Mamizou:
Perfect timing.
This is the first time I've had the chance to meet a Menreiki.

??? [Womanly Mask]:
Who're you?

Mamizou:
Nice to meetcha. I'm Futatsuiwa from Sado.

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
Nice to meetcha, too. I'm Hata no Kokoro.

Mamizou:
From what I've heard, someone made you a Mask of Hope. Isn't that right?

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
You sure know a lot.

Mamizou:
So, given that, what are you doing?

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
I'm looking for the Mask of Hope.
Where could it be...?

Mamizou:
You say some strange things.
Was the new mask not suitable for you?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
No, that Mask of Hope was...
It was certainly a Mask of Hope, but...

Mamizou:
You sound like you're worried about something. May I help you?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
That Mask of Hope was too perfect.

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
It was perfect as a tool.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
With that, we'd lose our individual selves.

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
We'd return to being regular masks. Just a pile of all 66.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Should we accept returning to being ordinary, speechless tools?

Mamizou:
I understand.
You finally managed to awaken to your sense of self as a youkai,
so you couldn't just sit back and watch as you lost it.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
We've looked for a way to not rely on the mask,

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
and we've tried our best to restore the original mask,

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
but we still haven't been able to tell which is the right path...

Mamizou:
"We"...? Okay, I got it.

Mamizou:
Don't worry. I'm on your side.
I know a lot about tsukumogami and the like.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Really!?

Mamizou:
So, just don't worry and fight with me.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Why should I do that?

Mamizou:
You see all those people around us?

Mamizou:
Could you really ignore all those excited onlookers?

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
It's been such a long time since I've seen such happy humans...

Mamizou:
For the sake of your sense of self, let's give them a good show!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
That's my line!
Behold the elegant Noh play of the reborn Menreiki!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
All right! I'm gonna do my best!

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
...Greetings. 'Tis I, Hata no Kokoro. I demand a duel forthwith.

Ichirin:
You don't need an introduction like that for a duel.
Fight me for the title of the strongest!
Something like that is fine.

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
I accept your challenge!

Ichirin:
Unquestionably weak.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Winning is fun~

Ichirin:
You should smile when you're having fun.

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
Smile smile!

Nitori:
Oh, my. You're Miss Kokoro, aren't you?
Thank you so much for always buying from me.

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Fight me for the title of the strongest!

Nitori:
Eh?
The title of the strongest? What happened?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Heh heh heh.

Nitori:
When exactly did I get to be the strongest?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Going out to meet people is fun too.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
I understand why everyone fights now.

Nitori:
I lost the title of the strongest~

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Found ya!

Koishi:
Who is it~?

Koishi:
Ah, it's you!

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
This time I'll defeat you for sure!

Koishi:
Yay„Éº Anybody's welcome!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Heh heh heh, I've been training for this. So it won't go like last time!

Koishi:
I've got hope in me, you know! Like I could lose!

Koishi:
I'm ready for a challenge any time!

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
I won! I'm so happy!

Koishi:
Wah, my Mask of Hope~

Kokoro:
I don't need that old Mask of Hope anymore.
I've got my hands on these things called emotions.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Yay! I feel like I'm gonna duel here too~

Futo:
If it isn't the Menreiki.
I'd heard you were in the midst of your rebirth?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
That's right~

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
I'm studying everyone's emotions~

Futo:
You've brightened considerably, to be sure.
...seems your intelligence has dwindled as well, though.

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Now, fight me for the title of the strongest!

Futo:
Very well! With this, you shall study the feeling of chagrin!

Futo:
That is chagrin.

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
How fun~

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Duels are full of fun, huh.

Futo:
In life, where there is joy, there is sorrow.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Aw... you flatter me.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
So, where's the next person to entertain me~?

Marisa:
There you are.
You've had a ton of influence lately.

Kokoro [Lion Mask]:
Influence?

Marisa:
Popularity. Your popularity.

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
Popularity...

Marisa:
So, how 'bout it? Wanna have a match between you and me?

Kokoro:
I'll do it~ For the title of the strongest~

Marisa:
...uh, you've changed a bit.

Marisa:
I'm the strongest!

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Ta-da! You got "the Strongest #5"!

Marisa:
I lost... I even tried harder than usual.

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
Hrmm...

Marisa:
What's wrong?

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
My limbs feel heavy... What is this?

Marisa:
This is your fifth duel, right?
You're just tired.

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
This is the face of tiredness!

Marisa:
Wrong!

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
She said I'm tired, huh...

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
Is that really it?

Mamizou:
So how is it?

Mamizou:
Have you grown a bit from meeting people?

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
I have!

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Right now I wouldn't lose to anyone!

Mamizou:
Huh? That's some rather unexpected growth.

Kokoro:
Now, fight me for the title of the strongest!

Mamizou:
Well, this is pretty youkai-like too, so it should be fine.

Mamizou:
Still a long way to go.

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
Ah, so tired~

Mamizou:
You even learnt the facial expression for tiredness?
I don't think it suits you, though.
It's like your worries have been blown away.

Kokoro [Old Woman Mask]:
Worries...

Mamizou:
Even if we just leave things be after this, your sense of self should awaken from the hope welling up within you.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
!

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
...it's not enough!

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
There are still hurdles I must overcome!

Mamizou:
Eh? Wh-what's this all of a sudden?

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
That's it! I've got it!
I know now who my enemies are!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
The religious leaders, who toy with people's emotions!
The time has come to part from them!

Reimu:
What! The village is like this again?
I thought we fixed the whole "berserk emotions" thing already...

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
So you came.
I am Hata no Kokoro, the one who rules over emotions.

Reimu:
I know.
More importantly, even though I heard that you've been reborn in some weird way...
What exactly is going on here? What are you trying to do?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
I've realized something.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
The dazzling danmaku,
the flashy laser beams,
the overwhelming martial arts...

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
It was all done by you religious leaders to stir up the people's emotions, wasn't it?

Reimu:
Yeah, that's our job.

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
I must correct this.

Reimu:
How eager!

Byakuren:
Are you going out of control again?
Your emotions still haven't stabilized, miss Menreiki.

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Guh.

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
You arrived just in time.
I'm gonna pulverize you all.

Miko:
I heard everything!
This girl's misconduct is my responsibility to begin with.
I shall return her to a group of ordinary tools at once.

Kokoro [Monkey Mask]:
You too...?
Well, I can defeat you all at once.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
If I don't part from the religious leaders, controlling my emotions will be impossible!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Having the three of you together is actually quite convenient for me!

Reimu:
Excuse me...
In the interests of sportsmanship, let me handle this...

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
You scared? Come at me together!

Byakuren:
Well, since she's asking so nicely.

Miko:
Indeed, it would be rude not to.

Reimu:
W-well, okay. In that case it's fine.
Okay! Let's go!

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
(No lines)

Reimu:
The basic principle of religion is to restrain emotions!
That is to say, Menreiki! Listen closely!
Making you behave yourself is our job! Hold not this against us!

Reimu:
S-sportsmanship is...

Reimu:
Who are you?

Reimu:
Don't tell me you're a tanuki.

Reimu:
You don't even care about religion, do you?

Reimu:
Leave the youkai extermination to me.

Reimu:
How about letting the old man there have a say?

Reimu:
I can't possibly lose to youkai or Buddhism!

Reimu:
No way I can lose to Buddhism. You don't allow alcohol.

Reimu:
What's written on that scroll of yours?

Reimu:
Don't waste plates!

Reimu:
From what I hear.
Apparently you're descended from Nigihayahi no Mikoto?

Reimu:
I won't lose to such a selfish religion!

Reimu:
By the way...
The audience is definitely acting weird.
Have you heard anything?

Reimu:
You were using the festival to price-gouge, weren't you?

Reimu:
Huh? Who did I fight just now?

Reimu:
I've peeled off your disguise!

Reimu:
Can you stop transforming into me? It's a terrible imitation, anyway...

Reimu:
Your masks are really freaky.

Reimu:
You have finally found it?
I wonder what kind of expression 
your real Mask of Hope even has.

Reimu:
The power of the gods wins out in the end.

Reimu:
It would be great if I got some more worshipers from this.

Marisa:
Easy victory today. Well, I guess I'm used to your moves.

Marisa:
Oh yeah, can I ask you something real quick?
My mini-hakkero has been kinda... Nah, it's nothing. Never mind.

Marisa:
Huh? Just what the heck was I fighting?

Marisa:
I foresaw ya, old man!

Marisa:
This monk is weak down to her robes.

Marisa:
If chanting sutras can make me stronger, I'll chant 'em all I can.

Marisa:
Everyone stinks of incense around you. Lame.

Marisa:
If you wanna draw a crowd, you should try spinning those plates instead.

Marisa:
You oughta fix up that old accent of yours. Try talking more modern-like.

Marisa:
Everlasting youth and life... Huh.

Marisa:
Is there any difference between Taoism and magic?

Marisa:
That backpack of yours sure looks heavy.

Marisa:
Oh yeah...
When are you gonna hold that bazaar this year? Gonna sell masks and stuff?

Marisa:
Before I knew it, I was fightin' someone. ...I got no what what I'm talking about.

Marisa:
Even if you turn into me, I don't smell like no animal.

Marisa:
Do you really have 66 different masks?

Marisa:
Noh... What's up with that? Ain't it just a slow dance?

Marisa:
What's this religious war thing? Don't go leavin' me out.

Marisa:
I see through all of your tricks.

Ichirin:
If I best the shrine maiden, this whole religious war has already been won.

Ichirin:
Now, count the number of youkai you defeated! That's how deep you'll be going in hell!

Ichirin:
You can also enter Buddhism as a layperson.

Ichirin:
Okay, now I'll tell you how to join the priesthood.

Ichirin:
...... Is this a transformed tanuki or fox?

Ichirin:
Thank you for reciting the scriptures, Mistress.

Ichirin:
Mistress, may I ask for your opinion?
What do you think about the Buddhist scriptures that forbid drinking alcohol?

Ichirin:
Enemies of Buddhism? We don't have bad intentions, so why fight us?

Ichirin:
Clean up these plates right now!

Ichirin:
To only use the secrets of the cosmos for yourself is heresy, you know.

Ichirin:
If you enter our temple, you can live only on cucumbers.

Ichirin:
Could this be... what complete mental selflessness is?

Ichirin:
You're a friend of Miss Nue, aren't you?

Ichirin:
Won't you pretend to be Unzan?

Ichirin:
So... 
What's "Monkey Possession"?

Ichirin:
Don't the masks become smelly?

Ichirin:
Repent!

Ichirin:
Huh? What's that, Unzan? You hate bullying the weak? You sure are lenient...

Byakuren:
With that many gods, it's no surprise there would be some fighting.

Byakuren:
You need more experience before you can defeat me, but you're not there yet.

Byakuren:
What should your dharma name be? I can think of one for you for a low price.

Byakuren:
You're bound by far too many worldly thoughts.

Byakuren:
When you live a long life, you see some curious things.

Byakuren:
My shrine is completely fire-resistant.

Byakuren:
Come to think of it,
You burned Buddhist statues? Then you should suffer Buddha's trials!

Byakuren:
Well, please leave this matter of Gensokyo to me.

Byakuren:
I can feel an ominous aura from you.

Byakuren:
Umm... More complaints...

Byakuren:
The kappa have a sizable independent community, so I'd like to spread my religion to them, but...

Byakuren:
Why do you want to join this battle?

Byakuren:
You should transform into a kettle again. Forever.

Byakuren:
You must not be swallowed by your emotions!

Byakuren:
It would be easier just to turn you back into an object...

Byakuren:
In truth all things are but a dream, shorter than the time it takes to cook millet. Hail the Three Jewels.

Byakuren:
Dueling is also instruction!

Byakuren:
Hmmm
Certainly Buddhism is the best suited for manipulating people.
[this pattern might appear only against Miko or not]

Futo:
I bear no great malice t'wards Shinto shrines. Let us forswear quarrels hence.

Futo:
I see. So this is a warrior maiden.

Futo:
Magic...? Pardon my belatedness, but how is it worked?

Futo:
You rouge, hast thou pilfered thee a plate?

Futo:
The weaker it be, the more it wants to show how big it is.

Futo:
A nyuudo monk, 'twould seem... They joineth "the Way" but depart from their families... How perplexing!

Futo:
If this bearing be that of Buddhists in the modern epoch, 'tis not worthy of apprehension.

Futo:
Didst thou knoweth the nuns of old shaved their heads?

Futo:
Do I find myself ensnared in the mischief of some tanuki?

Futo:
Is this strife becoming of ourselves?

Futo:
Zounds, a plate upon thy pate. For so near I came to breaking it, I beg thy forgiveness.

Futo:
Considering the habits of kappa
Thou should possess a restorative that healeth injuries of the wrist. Wouldst thou yieldeth a portion with me?

Futo:
Such a strange one. 'Twould seem that thy study and contemplation hath been apart from aid.

Futo:
E'en if thy mopery dost catch me unawares, there is scant to fear once I descry thy traps!

Futo:
Verily, thy tail doth reveal itself.

Futo:
Tanuki are most comtemporary of late. To imagine that they wouldst don westerly attire and soareth through the skies!

Futo:
Masks bear emotion most well. And those for theater all the more.

Futo:
Wouldst the outcome remain unchanged 
had you all 66 masks... 
That wouldst be a sight to behold.

Futo:
Thou art yet inexperienced. Myself as well.

Futo:
Accomplishing thy defeat is a task e'en simpler than breaking plates.

Miko:
Rest already. The matter this time is too heavy for you.

Miko:
It was strange for a shrine maiden to go spreading her religion from the start.

Miko:
That item of yours took me by surprise...
Is that not a hakkero? It is for use in alchemy...

Miko:
You show promise. Would you like to become my disciple?

Miko:
Is the gentleman over there not going to say anything?

Miko:
When all is said and done, you are simply a cemetery girl with an big-eyed old man.

Miko:
Leave the peace of Gensokyo to me. Understanding the desires of others is my forte!

Miko:
I did not think you were supposed to strike others with the palm of Buddha.

Miko:
You are not there yet. Keep training.

Miko:
The price for those plates is no laughing matter.

Miko:
Reevaluating myself is also a part of training.

Miko:
You act uninterested in popular trends... But I can tell it is because of your graceless heart that you cannot find genuine happiness.

Miko:
The kappa nowadays can certainly make many sorts of items.

Miko:
I do not understand. What are you fighting for?

Miko:
A long-living tanuki turns into a strong youkai indeed.

Miko:
You came from the land of Sado? Where is it?

Miko:
Have you become accustomed to your new mask yet?

Miko:
To think that the masks I created 
would turn out like this...
I should substitute them for new ones 
while she is rehearsing.

Miko:
Surely you were not fighting seriously, I hope.

Miko:
Harmony is to be valued. Meaning you shall never oppose me again.

Nitori:
You're pretty weak. Why do you act so important?

Nitori:
Gods have no reason to help youkai.

Nitori:
So, Miss Marisa What will you buy today?

Nitori:
Do you need a new broom? It's the same price as it was 30 years ago.

Nitori:
Why do you bother with something like Buddhism, when you're a youkai?

Nitori:
There are a lot of monks who became youkai...
Surely Buddhism is for people who don't want to be human anymore.

Nitori:
Say, can I sell incense too? I could dry out some of that driftwood.

Nitori:
A plate that restores itself when it's broken, huh... I guess necessity is the mother of invention.

Nitori:
Hey, hey What could I sell to Taoists?

Nitori:
Your governing policies could do with some maintenance too!

Nitori:
That was an afterimage!

Nitori:
That was a puppet copy of me!

Nitori:
Eh? You want this wrench? How much can you pay?

Nitori:
Eh? You want this crowbar? Too bad! This is really just a crowbar-like object!

Nitori:
Don't you get it?
No matter how famous you are in the outside world, if you act all self-important here you're gonna get in trouble some day.

Nitori:
What? The outside world's machines break if they get wet? That's ridiculous.

Nitori:
We have new masks in store. Which one will it be?

Nitori:
If you dance around at the whims of a festival, you're just a mindless duck.

Nitori:
Why are they all getting so excited? Everyone has some low standards around here.

Koishi:
Let's help myself to some donation money.

Koishi:
Even if I go to a shrine, nobody probably will notice me.

Koishi:
Where do you live? You seem like you're from a bad upbringing~

Koishi:
Shall we exchange your hat with mine?

Koishi:
Huh~? Weren't you in the Former Hell before? I see you're already released~

Koishi:
I wanna try Buddhism too~ How should I do it?

Koishi:
Oh yeah isn't there a girl called Minamitsu in your temple?
She drowned in the Hell of Blood Pools, did you know?

Koishi:
Plates, huh~ I'm confident that I can walk through them with my eyes shut.

Koishi:
Why are you covering your ears? You feel cold?

Koishi:
Even if you say you have everlasting youth and life, you actually die, don't you? Everyone does.

Koishi:
We have kappa underground too, but they're more ferocious.

Koishi:
Hey general store person~ I want those boots of yours~

Koishi:
You've been a bad person‚ô™

Koishi:
Tanuki and kitsune don't go well together, do they? Which one tastes better?

Koishi:
This is mine„Éº

Koishi:
Show me your angry face.

Koishi:
It's better if you fight more by your instincts.

Koishi:
Huh~? That's disappointing.

Koishi:
Everyone had an invisible friend that the adults can't see, right? Uhuhu.

Mamizou:
Leaf money is convenient, no? You can use them for donation money or anything.

Mamizou:
It's easy to transform into you. You're already tanuki-like.

Mamizou:
There are lots of magicians in the outside world too.

Mamizou:
You caught some tanuki recently, didn't you Are you making tanuki hot pot?

Mamizou:
You're weak because you don't eat meat.

Mamizou:
It's not easy to transform into a nyuudou.

Mamizou:
That's right. Next time we duel why don't we bet on the temple plaque?

Mamizou:
There are places with names called Eboshi all over Japan, did you know?

Mamizou:
Feng shui utilizes the power of nature. However, we hold powers that surpasses nature's.

Mamizou:
Even if you're a hermit, a human is a human. It's all the same to the people being deluded.

Mamizou:
The sword you carry is a decoration? Somehow it smells like it could make a lot of money.

Mamizou:
Wouldn't that propeller design make your body spin? How does that work?

Mamizou:
What's the power source? Electricity? Steam? Or the unknown...

Mamizou:
A satori...huh. It won't be easy to transform into you.

Mamizou:
What, you can't read minds?
A satori who can't read minds are like tanuki who can't transform into humans.

Mamizou:
No good, no good. I can't tell which one is the real thing.

Mamizou:
Huh? So if you have a fox and monkey mask, 
do you have a tanuki one?

Mamizou:
Oh, you even have a tanuki mask. ...Wonder what emotion is it?
"The face when making immoral scams"
......I see.

Mamizou:
You're still not good enough.

Mamizou:
Let's leave it at that for today.

Mamizou:
"Let's leave it at that for today" is something you say when you win, not when running away, you know?

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Your level of hope can't fulfill me.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Hey hey let's do it again‚ô™ This is the face for joy.

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
Hey hey This is the face for pretending to be a Buddha statue~

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
I see~ I need to control my emotions freely~

Kokoro [Surprised Mask]:
Hey hey This is the face for pretending to be a plate spinner~

Kokoro [Old Woman mask]:
The new mask of hope... I don't really want to put it on.

Kokoro:
How do you make those masks that you put up in your stall?

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
I found you! My nemesis!

Kokoro:
Even if you return it...
...well...
I got a new mask already, so 
I don't really need it anymore.

Kokoro [Fox Mask]:
Hey hey This is the face for pretending to be a tanuki~

Kokoro [Womanly Mask]:
What, what? What face should I have for this situation...?

Kokoro [Hannya Mask]:
Not enough to even talk about! This is the face for anger.

Kokoro [Laughing Mask]:
Yay~ I won. This is the face for happiness.

Kokoro [Surprised mask]:
Weak! Too weak! This is the face for surprise.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Hey hey This is the face for rebuff.

Kokoro [Hyottoko Mask]:
Too weak, so boring... This is the face for sadness.

Reimu:
Were there really any youkai who would run amok in this lake?

???:
It's you!

Wakasagihime:
You're that famous shrine maiden, aren't you?

Reimu:
Oh, a mermaid?
Is that all? You're just a small fry.

Wakasagihime:
It's been ages since anyone took us seriously.
It's about time for us youkai to flourish!

Reimu:
And here I thought that mermaids were a quiet sort of youkai.
Something is definitely going on.
This purification rod is worrying me a bit, too.

Reimu:
Youkai are rampaging this close to the Human Village!?
We've got a bona fide incident on our hands.

???:
You showed up fast.

Sekibanki:
Have you come to exterminate me?

Reimu:
Thanks for coming out on your own. You saved me a lot of searching.
I'll make this quick!

Sekibanki:
...So, it's true.
Humans really have gotten swollen heads now that we've been calm for a while.

Reimu:
A small fry like you shouldn't be acting so huffy!

Sekibanki:
...Says the powerless human.

Sekibanki:
I'll give you a nightmare every time you see a head!

Sekibanki:
Wh-What's with you? You're actually strong.

Reimu:
Well, youkai extermination IS my speciality.

Sekibanki:
Could you perhaps be...?

Reimu:
That's right! Do you not see this purification rod!?

Sekibanki:
Hahah... I must be leaving then...

???:
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

Reimu:
Huh... It's like all the youkai I beat today...
Actually wanted to be exterminated.

Kagerou:
Does it look like that to you?
I think everyone is just a little happy.

Reimu:
Happy!?

Kagerou:
Even if you declare yourself to be some youkai-exterminating professional,
You haven't always fought independently-acting youkai like us.

Reimu:
Well... There'd be no end to it.
I can't go around fighting the ones not making a mess.
But I really do want to attack them, with no questions asked.

Kagerou:
Hahaha. All right, I'll take you on...

Kagerou:
There's no other choice but to get wild.

Reimu:
I won't have any mercy on wild youkai!

Kagerou:
What a pity. And on a night with such a beautiful full moon...

Reimu:
I wondered what youkai you were. So you're a werewolf.

Kagerou:
Geez... I lost, even with the full moon.

Reimu:
You're just an animal, after all.
You have to use your head for danmaku, not just raw power.
Great, now the purification rod smells like animal.

Kagerou:
You're so cruel...
I didn't even want to come out today, but I fought you anyway.

Reimu:
You didn't want to come out today? Even though it's a full moon? Even though you're a werewolf?

Kagerou:
Well, because I get all hairy...

Reimu:
I-I see.

Reimu:
What the heck is this creepy storm?
There's got to be an enemy around here! Based on my experience!

???:
I spy...

Benben:
Someone who looks like they could be my opponent...

Reimu:
See? I knew there'd be a youkai.
I'll take on you or anyone.

Yatsuhashi:
Wait a sec. I found her first.
First come first served, big sis.

Benben:
And why's that?
You saw her first, but your shoddy music won't be enough...
...to defeat this tsukumogami user.

Reimu:
Tsukumogami user!?
Don't speak of me as if I'm a youkai. I'm here to exterminate youkai like you.

Benben:
Hmmm......
I thought you were one of us for sure, though...

Yatsuhashi:
Well, whatever. I'll leave her to you, Benben.
See you later„Éº

Reimu:
Hey, wai-

Benben:
Well now, let's not stand around waiting.

Benben:
In this world of social upheaval where everything is turned on its head...
Who is the strongest tool? We'll decide that here and now!

Benben:
Nngh. Okay, I lost.
I surrender„Éº

Reimu:
Wait, wait.
What did you mean by "world of social upheaval"?

Benben:
Huh?
I mean... All the other tools like me have gained power.
We've behaved ourselves so far, but it'll be our era from now on.

Reimu:
H-huh.

Benben:
You're also heading there in this storm, right?

Reimu:
There?

Benben:
That inverted castle floating in the sky... There's power leaking out from there, you see.

???:
What? What do you want?
This isn't a place for humans like you.
Leave at once!

Reimu:
You can't possibly think I'd just say "okay" and be on my way.
What are you thinking, building this huge castle in the air?

Seija:
...Ah. I see, that purification rod...
It seems to have gained a sense of self.
So that means that led you here, doesn't it?

Reimu:
What?

Seija:
This is a problem. The price for that might be too big.
I might not be able to overturn society so easily now...

Reimu:
Hey, are you...
Are you seriously trying to overthrow society...?

Seija:
Heh heh heh. Absolutely.
From here on, the strong shall lose their power and the weak will unify the world!

Reimu:
I'm shocked.
I can't believe there are youkai who would do something no one would benefit from like that.

Seija:
Nobody would benefit, you say...?
None of you understand how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed. So...

Seija:
In this inverted castle where everything is overturned, I'll give you a taste of this earnest frustration!

Seija:
Ugh. How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

Reimu:
That's it? And you were trying to overthrow society?
I've defeated tons of youkai stronger than you, you know.

Seija:
Not yet. I haven't given up!
As long as we have that treasure, we can become as strong as we want.
...As long as we can turn a blind eye to the price.

Reimu:
Hey, wait!
Is she trying to get away? That's something a youkai who's all talk would do.
Actually, it almost seems like she's leading me instead.

Reimu:
Looks like the daybreak just arrived.
The stage for our battle is nice and set.
Now, show yourself! The one disturbing Gensokyo's peace!

???:
Who's theeere?

???:
Oh, if it isn't the Hakurei shrine maiden.
Hm... it looks like your purification rod has some of my treasure's power.
Does that mean you're here as one of my allies?

Reimu:
Huh? Who are you calling an ally?

???:
This is wonderful‚àí! With the shrine maiden's support,
I'll be able to turn Gensokyo upside-down with no problem.

Reimu:
So you really are plotting to overthrow society?
You know I'd never go along with something like that, right?

Shinmyoumaru:
Tools can't speak, and they're worked and worked until they fall apart.
They're not allowed to think of anything besides working...
You thank them for their daily work, and you have memorial services when they break...
But the only ones who think that would be satisfactory are the masters (powerful) who use them!

Reimu:
Ummm?

Shinmyoumaru:
So? That tool of yours seems happier now, doesn't it?
You're using it so gladly that I didn't even have to ask.

Reimu:
Well, uh, that's... ummm.

Shinmyoumaru:
Now join me, and create a world where the tools (weak) can spend their days in happiness!

Reimu:
But still!
There's no way I can ally myself with someone trying to overthrow society!

Shinmyoumaru:
Someone like you, who was born into power, wouldn't know the joy of finally obtaining it.
However, if you look at your purification rod, you can see that you feel hesitation.
I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the "Miracle Mallet"!

Reimu:
The Miracle... Mallet!? If you have that, then does that mean...

Shinmyoumaru:
I can see a future where you understand your weakness and ally with me.
Now, my treasured mallet! Impart the power of dreams to all the speechless tools!

Reimu:
Were there really any youkai who would run amok in this lake?

???:
Hey, you!

Wakasagihime:
You're that famous shrine maiden, aren't you?
Huh? You don't have a weapon.
Does that mean you haven't come to exterminate me?

Reimu:
I came to exterminate you, but that purification rod, well...

Wakasagihime:
You're underestimating me!
You ought to reaffirm the terror that we youkai hold!

Reimu:
And here I thought that mermaids were a quiet sort of youkai.
Something's definitely going on.

Reimu:
Youkai are rampaging this close to the Human Village!?
We've got a bona fide incident on our hands.

???:
You showed up fast.

Sekibanki:
Have you come to exterminate me?

Reimu:
Thanks for coming out on your own. You saved me a lot of searching.
I'll make this quick!

Sekibanki:
...So, it's true.
Humans really have gotten swollen heads now that we've been calm for a while.

Reimu:
Hey, wait... Aren't you a rokurokubi?

Sekibanki:
That's right. There isn't a human alive who isn't afraid of me!

Sekibanki:
Wh-What's with you? You're actually strong.

Reimu:
Well, youkai extermination IS my speciality.

Sekibanki:
Could you perhaps be...

Reimu:
You just realized it now?

Sekibanki:
My, my... If it isn't that shrine's maiden.
The one infamous for being overrun with youkai.

???:
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

Reimu:
Huh... It's like all the youkai I beat today...
Actually wanted to be exterminated.

Kagerou:
Does it look like that to you?
I think everyone is just a little happy.

Reimu:
Happy!?

Kagerou:
Even if you declare yourself to be some youkai-exterminating professional,
You haven't always fought independently-acting youkai like us.

Reimu:
It's not like I have the time for it.
I wish you wouldn't cause a ruckus just to get my attention.

Kagerou:
If you get too presumptuous, you're going to regret it.
And of all times, on this night of a full moon.

Reimu:
I wondered what youkai you were. So you were a werewolf.

Kagerou:
Geez... I lost, even with the full moon.

Reimu:
All these normally docile youkai are going crazy lately.
Why is that?

Kagerou:
I don't know. Maybe it's just coincidental?
At the very least, I'm acting on my own will. ...Probably.

Reimu:
Hum.
That seems odd.

Kagerou:
I don't even want to come out on nights of the full moon, either.

Reimu:
Why's that? You were all upbeat just a little while ago.

Kagerou:
Well, look... It's a pain to clean up the hair that falls out.

Reimu:
Ah... I see.

Reimu:
What the heck is this creepy storm?
There's got to be an enemy around here! Based on my experience!

???:
Wait a sec.

Yatsuhashi:
Why don't you fight with me?

Reimu:
See? I knew there'd be a youkai.
I'll take on you or anyone.

Benben:
Now, now. That's my prey, you know.
Swiping her away is not very admirable behavior.

Yatsuhashi:
Hmmph! It's your fault for running away.
I saw you fighting her earlier, anyway.
Your plain, linear music won't work on her, big sis.

Reimu:
Err...
I don't really care, so can we start now?

Yatsuhashi:
All right. Let's do this, then?
It's always been my dream to fight against a human and win, you know.

Benben:
Well, whatever. I'll just look for another opponent.
I'll leave the rest to you.

Reimu:
Hey, wait...

Yatsuhashi:
Who are you looking at? You're messing with ME!

Yatsuhashi:
The meek have gained power in this world of social upheaval.
Even mere tools can rule the world! I'll make you the foundation we'll stand on!

Yatsuhashi:
Oh, geez.
You're strong-

Reimu:
Wait, wait.
What did you mean by "world of social upheaval"?

Yatsuhashi:
Huh?
I mean... Even tools like myself can possess power.
Isn't that awesome? This is no time to be sitting around.

Reimu:
The tools have power?

Yatsuhashi:
Even the youkai who've been docile up until now have gotten more powerful, too.
That's how social upheaval works!

Reimu:
Huh? They've gotten powerful? What are you--

Yatsuhashi:
That inverted castle floating in the sky... Power is overflowing from it.

???:
What? What do you want?
This isn't a place for humans like you.
Leave at once!

Reimu:
You can't possibly think I'd just say "okay" and be on my way.
What are you thinking, building this huge castle in the air?

Seija:
You want to hear? I bet you do, huh?
To tell you the truth, we're plotting to overthrow society!
It doesn't have much to do with you, since you humans will end up under our heels.

Reimu:
So there are people who would seriously consider social upheaval.

Seija:
What? Aren't you surprised?

Reimu:
Well, the koto tsukumogami I met earlier was saying things like that.

Seija:
What? A koto tsukumogami...?
I see. That must be part of the payment.

Reimu:
...?

Seija:
Well, whatever. That just means we have more allies!
From here on, the strong shall lose their power and the weak will control the world!

Reimu:
I'm shocked.
I can't believe there are youkai who would do something no one would benefit from like that.

Seija:
Nobody would benefit... you say?
None of you understand how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed. So...

Seija:
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down, I'll give you a taste of this earnest frustration!

Seija:
Ugh. How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

Reimu:
Overthrowing society...
I won't allow you to cast Gensokyo into chaos!

Seija:
Chaos? Just like a human. You don't understand.
My history is filled with disgrace and oppression, just for not having any power.
Now is the time for revenge!

Reimu:
Hey, wait--!
Well, I suppose I should chase her? Yeah, let's do that.

Reimu:
Looks like the daybreak just arrived.
The stage for our battle is nice and set.
Now, show yourself! The one disturbing Gensokyo's peace!

???:
Who's theeere?

Shinmyoumaru:
Oh, if it isn't the Hakurei shrine maiden.
You came at just the right time.

Reimu:
I have no idea who you are, but you're planning to overthrow society, right?
Sorry, but this plot of yours ends here!

???:
Uh-oh, it seems the shrine maiden finally caught on...
But I won't give up!

Shinmyoumaru:
I won't rest until you all know the kind of humiliation that
the inchling race has endured!

Reimu:
Inchling!?
They really exist?

Shinmyoumaru:
Yes, of course! You've always ignored the inchlings.
None of you understand the feelings of the weak.
That's why I'm going to overthrow society!

Reimu:
If you know you're weak, then you should behave yourself.
That's the law (truth) of Gensokyo!
And besides, how does someone weak like you expect to win against me?

Shinmyoumaru:
Ahahaha. I suppose the strong and weak really are incompatible...

Shinmyoumaru:
However, I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the "Miracle Mallet"!

Reimu:
The Miracle... Mallet!? If you have that, then does that mean...

Shinmyoumaru:
You're right to be scared. I can see a strong person trying to flee from me.
Now, my treasured mallet! Impart your power of dreams to all those of small stature!

Marisa:
It's a bit chilly.

???:
Hey, you!

Wakasagihime:
Have you come to exterminate me?

Marisa:
Hm? Oh, yeah, I guess.
Anyway, a mermaid, huh? Sashimi...

Wakasagihime:
Okay! I just have to beat you and I'll gain status!
The dawn of the reign of us youkai is coming!

Marisa:
She was just a half-fish after all. No big deal.
Sashimi... tempura...
Nah, that's not it.

Marisa:
So, youkai are showin' up even in a place like this.
And here I thought the seats under the willows were reserved for phantoms.

???:
You'd be surprised how many are here.

Sekibanki:
As well as how many dwell near the Human Village.

Marisa:
Hey, I ran into ya a little while ago.

Sekibanki:
I won't let you get away with not being afraid of me.

Marisa:
But I'm already tired of beatin' up youkai like you.

Sekibanki:
This insolence is what causes youkai to retaliate.

Sekibanki:
I'll make you too scared to walk around, day or night!

Sekibanki:
Wh-What's with you? You're actually strong.

Marisa:
'Course I am. If I were weak, I'd be sleepin' at home.
Now, then... The punishment for bad girls is death.

Sekibanki:
Uh, no, thanks.
Humans these days are so rough!

Marisa:
She escaped, huh?
And here I thought I could give her a scorching with my Hakkero.

???:
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

Marisa:
Ahhhh, ya sound like ya wanna be exterminated.

Kagerou:
Do you think you can defeat me?

Marisa:
Hmm, probably.
That glossy hair does look pretty flammable.

Kagerou:
Huh? Flammable?

Marisa:
I'm gonna to burn ya to a crisp with my Hakkero!

Kagerou:
Hehehe. Go ahead and try it, if you think you can hit me!
You'll regret the bad luck you had fighting me on this moon-blessed ground!

Marisa:
A werewolf, huh...?
Why didn't ya fight seriously?

Kagerou:
Huh? I thought I was fighting seriously...

Marisa:
I bet you'd get stronger if you lost those bulky clothes.

Kagerou:
But... Well, I get all hairy on full moon, so...

Marisa:
Hairy? Even for a wolf?
Eh, that don't matter anyway.
Since you're half-beast, I can cook ya to my heart's content.

Kagerou:
Eek, my cuticles!

Marisa:
I'm gonna give ya a full-body afro. --hm.
I don't have to go that far... Right...?

Marisa:
I thought these clouds appeared suddenly, but this's really somethin' else.
There's gotta be a bad guy in here.

???:
I spy~

Benben:
Someone who looks like they could be my opponent.

Marisa:
Well, I sure found ya quick.
Guess I just gotta search in places where the youkai wanna fight.

Yatsuhashi:
Wait a sec. I found her first.
First come first served, big sis.

Benben:
And why's that?
You saw her first, but your shoddy music won't be enough...
...to defeat this tsukumogami user.

Marisa:
Woah. What? There's two tsukumogami?
Perfect, I can take down two birds with one stone!

Benben:
We certainly don't need two almighty tsukumogami.
Could you step back, please?

Yatsuhashi:
Hmm. Well, whatever. I'll leave her to you, Benben.
See you later„Éº

Marisa:
Hey, no runnin' away!

Benben:
Hold it! You will be facing me.

Benben:
In this world of social upheaval where everything is turned on its head...
Who is the strongest tool? We'll decide that here and now!

Benben:
Nngh. Okay, I lost.
I surrender„Éº

Marisa:
Ya sure talk big for a weakling.
I didn't think such a shoddy tool would be able to withstand my Mini-Hakkero.

Benben:
This is unfortunate, but I can't do much about it. I'll hand the title of strongest tsukumogami over to you.

Marisa:
Tsukumogami...?
What was that? D'ya mean me?

Benben:
Well, go on ahead. Over that way.

Marisa:
That way? What the heck's over there...?

Benben:
Huh? That inverted castle, obviously.
Our power is overflowing from that very building.

???:
What? What do you want?
This isn't a place for humans like you.
Leave at once!

Marisa:
Not happenin'.
This place is too interestin' for me to leave empty-handed.

Seija:
...Ah. That tool in your hand...
It seems to have gained a sense of self.
Will you become our ally as well?

Marisa:
Whaddya mean "ally"? What are ya planning?

Seija:
We are a force of resistance.
We'll use the princess's treasure to turn Gensokyo on its head.

Marisa:
O-oh. I see. That's a big deal.

Seija:
You, too, must be a weak youkai, only recently come to life, right?

Marisa:
Y-Youkai?
Are ya makin' fun of me? I'm a human.

Seija:
Well, fine. Even humans will be welcome allies.

Marisa:
There's no way I'd agree with somethin' like turnin' Gensokyo upside-down.

Seija:
Oh, that's unfortunate... You're going to make that Hakkero (tsukumogami) cry, you know?

Seija:
The last thing it sees will be its owner, falling out of the sky!

Seija:
Ugh. How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

Marisa:
Man, that was such a let-down.
I thought you were going to give me a better fight.

Seija:
This just makes me want your power on our side even more.
As long as we have that treasure, you can become as strong as you want, too.

Marisa:
Treasure, ya say?

Seija:
Maybe our next approach will change your mind.

Marisa:
Hey, wait!
Treasure, huh...?
That reminds me. My goal was to find myself some treasure.
Yeah! I'll chase her down and do just that!

Marisa:
Hey, it totally cleared up outside. That's rejuvenatin'.
...Kinda feels like I could do anythin' I wanted. I feel like I could even rule over Gensokyo right now.

???:
Who's theeere?

???:
Oh, it's that famous magician I've heard so much about.
Could you perhaps be here to turn the world upside-down with me?

Marisa:
No, uh...
Right, I remember. I-I'm here to take some treasure.

???:
Ahahaha! I knew it!
I can see that your heart longs for power.

Marisa:
What? How...?

???:
Having a human ally would be greatly reassuring to us.

Shinmyoumaru:
Thanks to the physical traits of the inchlings, no matter what we do, we're powerless.
There's almost nobody who wants to ally with us. We're just used, then thrown away.

Marisa:
You're an Inchling...? Ya don't look too small.

Shinmyoumaru:
Now that we've gained a greater power, this is our chance to turn the world upside-down!
You surely agree, right?

Marisa:
Umm. Turn it upside-down...? That seems interesting, but...
It'd make a total mess of my house, so I don't really wanna help ya.

Shinmyoumaru:
Then why do you desire my treasure's power?

Marisa:
I don't know what your treasure is in the first place, so...

Shinmyoumaru:
How amusing. Don't you want more power for your tool?
That power can be easily granted with this treasure, the "Miracle Mallet"!

Marisa:
The Miracle... Mallet!? The one that can grant any wish!?

Shinmyoumaru:
Yes! A treasure that can grant the power of dreams to all those who are weak!
Now, my treasured mallet! Shake the heart of this human named Marisa Kirisame!

Marisa:
It's a bit chilly.

???:
Hey, you!

Wakasagihime:
Have you come to exterminate me?

Marisa:
Hm? Oh, yeah, I guess.
Anyway, a mermaid, huh? I didn't know there was one in the lake.

Wakasagihime:
You always ignore me.
Isn't it about time us youkai had our day in the sun?

Marisa:
She was just a half-fish after all. No big deal.
Wouldn't she be stronger if she were all fish?

Marisa:
So, youkai are showin' up even in a place like this.
And here I thought the seats under the willows were reserved for phantoms.

???:
You'd be surprised how many are here.

Sekibanki:
As well as how many dwell near the Human Village.

Marisa:
Hey, I ran into ya a little while ago.

Sekibanki:
I won't let you let away with not being afraid of me.

Marisa:
Actually, ya did surprise me there when your head took off.

Sekibanki:
Do you want to...

Sekibanki:
See me do that again?

Sekibanki:
Were you scared?

Marisa:
Well, uh...
Not really. But ya grossed me out.

Sekibanki:
Urrgh...
Humans these days are so fearless.

Marisa:
Well, I'm just special.
Don't cause a racket in the village, okay? You'll make the kids cry.

???:
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

Marisa:
Ahhhh, ya sound like ya wanna be exterminated.

Kagerou:
Do you think you can defeat me?

Marisa:
Ya look pretty confident.
Didja set a trap or somethin'?

Kagerou:
Hehehe. It's because the moon is full tonight...

Marisa:
So what?
Uh...
A full moon in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost? I got a bad feelin' about this.

Kagerou:
Yes. Now is the time when the bamboo forest is a moon-blessed territory.
I feel sorry for you, having to fight me here...

Marisa:
A werewolf, huh?
I've been meetin' a lot of half-humans today. First was that mermaid in the lake...
Not sure about rokurokubi, though... Are they human from the neck down?

Kagerou:
A mermaid in the lake?... Do you mean Wakasagihime?

Marisa:
Yeah. Do ya know each other?

Kagerou:
Somewhat, thanks to the grassroots youkai network.
Though I also tried to eat her once by mistake.

Marisa:
Hmm, I see. So you are plottin' something, right?
A bunch of normally quiet youkai, gatherin' in secret...

Kagerou:
That girl, attacking people? Are you sure you're not mistaken?
That girl is so timid that she wouldn't even kill a fly!

Marisa:
Huh?

Kagerou:
Besides, the most I did was try and attack someone of my own accord.

Marisa:
Hmm... Doesn't seem like yer lying.
I see... Everyone's on edge.

Marisa:
I thought these clouds appeared suddenly, but this's really somethin' else.
There's gotta be a bad guy in here.

???:
Wait a sec.

Yatsuhashi:
Why don't you fight with me?

Marisa:
A tsukumogami, huh? Perfect.
If I follow someone like you, I oughta figger out why my Mini-Hakkero started actin' up.

Benben:
Now, now. That's my prey, you know.
Swiping her away is not very admirable behavior.

Yatsuhashi:
Hmmph! It's your fault for running away.
I saw you fighting her before, anyway.
Your plain, linear music won't work on her, big sis.

Marisa:
Ah, um...
I don't mind fighting both of you at once...

Yatsuhashi:
Well...
It's always been my dream to fight against a human and win, you know.

Benben:
Well, whatever. I'll just look for another opponent.
I'll leave the rest to you.

Marisa:
Huh, so it's just you, then.

Yatsuhashi:
Don't underestimate me just because I'm a tool.
The meek have gained power in this world of social upheaval.
Even mere tools can rule the world! I'll make you the foundation we'll stand on!

Yatsuhashi:
Wow„Éº
I can't stand up to that.

Marisa:
You said something weird before, didn'tcha?
A "world of social upheaval," or something?

Yatsuhashi:
I mean... Even tools like myself can possess power.
Isn't that awesome? This is no time to be sitting around.

Marisa:
So does that mean you're taking revenge on humans, or what?

Yatsuhashi:
Not just humans. We plan to rule the entire world someday.

Marisa:
Hah! Mere tools, ruling a world?
Wait, hold on... I see...
Is this why the Mini-Hakkero started moving on its own?
Could ya tell me more about this?

Yatsuhashi:
Even the youkai who've been docile up until now have gotten more powerful, too.
That's the kind of world it's turning into.
All of our power comes from there, that inverted castle floating in the sky...

???:
What? What do you want?
This isn't a place for humans like you.
Leave at once!

Marisa:
Not happenin'.
The reason my Mini-Hakkero's been goin' crazy has gotta be here.

Seija:
What are you talking about?

Marisa:
You've been controllin' the tsukumogami. You're plottin' something, right?
I heard it from a koto tsukumogami.

Seija:
From a tsukumogami?
Haha. I see. It must be part of the "payment".

Marisa:
Huh?

Seija:
The tsukumogami are nothing but a bonus. What I wish for is one thing only:
Social upheaval!
The strong shall lose their power and the weak will rule the world!
It doesn't have much to do with you, since you humans will end up under our heels.

Marisa:
Social upheaval? Can't have that now, can we?

Seija:
Why? For humans, it would be a world of more ease than the one now.

Marisa:
No, no. Because I'm one of the strong ones.
For me, "social upheaval" means a revolt.

Seija:
Ah... You don't understand either.
If the thought of how much we, the weak, have been oppressed so much
has never crossed your mind, then...

Seija:
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down, I'll give you a taste your first failure!

Seija:
Ugh. How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

Marisa:
I told ya I was one of the strong.
I'm surprised you could even think of flippin' the world on its head when you're so weak.

Seija:
Not yet. I haven't given up!
As long as we have that treasure, we can become as strong as we want.
...As long as we can turn a blind eye to the price.

Marisa:
Ah, wait!
You can become as strong... as ya want?
Now, don't that seem interestin'.
I'll just go ahead and follow her.

Marisa:
Hey, it's totally cleared up outside. That's rejuvenatin'.
In a place like this, how could anyone think about overthrowin' society?

???:
Who's theeere?

???:
Oh, it's that famous magician I've heard so much about.
You came at just the right time.

Marisa:
Are you plottin' to overturn society? I won't stand for that!

???:
The first obstacle is you, who has fought a hundred battles...
But I won't give up!

Shinmyoumaru:
I won't rest until you all know the kind of humiliation that
the inchling race has endured!

Marisa:
So you're an inchling...? Ya don't look too small.

Shinmyoumaru:
Now that we've gained a greater power, this is our chance to turn the world upside-down!

Marisa:
Heh. There's no way I'd lose to an inchling.
Ain't the whole reason you want to overthrow society because you're weak in the first place?
Bring it on! I'll never lose to a weakling!

Shinmyoumaru:
Ahahaha. I suppose the strong and weak really are incompatible...
However, I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the "Miracle Mallet"!

Marisa:
The Miracle... Mallet!? The one that can grant any wish!?

Shinmyoumaru:
You're right to be scared. I can see a strong person trying to flee from me.
Now, my treasured mallet! Impart your power of dreams to all the pitiful weaklings!

Sakuya:
So is this what lake cleaning is like?

???:
Hey, you!

Wakasagihime:
You're the one from that mansion on the bank...

Sakuya:
A half-fish person!?
I had no idea there was anything besides fairies living around this dead lake.

Wakasagihime:
See? That's how it is.
You've long forgotten about the existence of us youkai!

Sakuya:
So there were creatures like her in the neighborhood.
Hmm... How interesting. Maybe I shall take a look around.
I wish to test how keen the edge of this knife is.

Sakuya:
There are even youkai running amok this close to the Human Village...
It seems peace in Gensokyo is like the Tower of Babel upon sand.

???:
You showed up fast.

Sekibanki:
Have you come to exterminate me?

Sakuya:
Well, yes.
I felt like cutting something, such as a neck...

Sekibanki:
So there are fearless humans, too.

Sekibanki:
Though that only means they'll experience terror in return!

Sekibanki:
Wh-What's with you? You're actually strong.

Sakuya:
Did I even once say that I was weak?
But... My expectations were off.

Sekibanki:
Wh-What do you mean?

Sakuya:
Because I never needed to cut off your neck at all.

Sekibanki:
Gyah„Éº!

???:
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

Sakuya:
...How strange.
Do all of you want to be exterminated, perhaps?

Kagerou:
Do you think you can defeat me?

Sakuya:
Yes, I believe I can.

Kagerou:
O-Oh, a quick answer.

Sakuya:
I can't seem to restrain this knife today...

Kagerou:
Too bad for you, though. Trying to fight me,
on the night of the full moon...

Sakuya:
Who should it be but a wolfman.

Kagerou:
I'm a wolf-woman!

Sakuya:
Well, either way... Your blood will coat my knife.

Kagerou:
Eek!

Sakuya:
On second thought, that could dull its edge.
Let us just settle for striking you with the back.

Kagerou:
Striking me with the back...
Isn't that a double-edged knife?

Sakuya:
Hmhmhm. Well, either way...

Kagerou:
I'm scared... Humans are scary!

Sakuya:
Hmm...
What am I trying to accomplish by bullying around youkai like this?

Sakuya:
All these eerie clouds suddenly turned up.
It certainly doesn't seem like a natural phenomenon.

???:
I spy~

Benben:
Someone who looks like they could be my opponent.

Sakuya:
Wonderful, an enemy!
My knife was starting to get rather thirsty.

Yatsuhashi:
Wait a sec. I found her first.
First come first served, big sis.

Benben:
And why's that?
You saw her first, but your shoddy music won't be enough...
...to defeat this tsukumogami user.

Sakuya:
Tsukumogami user?
I see... This bewitched blade does seem like a tsukumogami.

Benben:
What are you saying?
It doesn't just "seem" like one, it IS one, no matter how you look at it.

Yatsuhashi:
Hmm. Well, whatever. I'll leave her to you, Benben.
See you later„Éº

Sakuya:
Escaping now, are we!?

Benben:
Hold it! You will be facing me.

Benben:
In this world of social upheaval where everything is turned on its head...
Who is the strongest tool? We'll decide that here and now!

Benben:
Nngh. Okay, I lost.
I surrender„Éº

Sakuya:
No matter how much it cuts, this blade does not grow dull.

Benben:
Well, of course. The whole world is ruled by tools right now.

Sakuya:
Ruled by tools? What are you talking about?

Benben:
Even youkai who are normally docile can possess power in this world now, right?
It would follow that tools would gain the strongest power of all.

Sakuya:
What kind of world is that? This is the first I have heard of it.

Benben:
You want to receive the same blessing too, right? You should go on ahead, then.

Sakuya:
To where, exactly?

Benben:
The inverted castle, of course! That's where our power is coming from.

???:
What? What do you want?
This isn't a place for humans like you.
Leave at once!

Sakuya:
I heard that tools who come here could be granted power.
I would like to hear the details...

Seija:
...Ah. That blade in your hand...
It seems to have gained a sense of self.
Maybe the price for that was too great if even those kinds of items were affected.

Sakuya:
I beg your pardon?

Seija:
Never mind. Do you want to become stronger?

Sakuya:
Well... I suppose so.

Seija:
Then become my ally.
We are a force of resistance. We will re-draw the political borders of Gensokyo!

Sakuya:
A resistance force!?
Well, well... I think I just overheard something important.

Seija:
So? Will you join our cause?

Sakuya:
Unfortunately, I am already attached to another political power.
To me, a resistance force means a revolt against us.
I never had the choice of becoming your ally from the start.

Seija:
I see... That is unfortunate.
If none of you can imagine how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed... Then...

Seija:
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down, I'll give you a taste of the humiliation the weak have suffered!

Seija:
Ugh. How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

Sakuya:
It seems you were all talk.
This blade could probably beat you by itself...

Seija:
Ugh... That sword's power is an effect of the "payment".
I can't believe it would become something that could slit necks on its own.
But it doesn't matter.
As long as we have that treasure, we can become as strong as we want.
Good bye.

Sakuya:
Ah...
Everything is clear now.
The reason why tools are moving on their own, and docile youkai are running wild...
is because of that amanojaku's resistance force.
I don't know how she did it yet, though.

Sakuya:
I beat the amanojaku, but...
What could this strange feeling be?
There must be someone here.

???:
Who's theeere?

Shinmyoumaru:
A human? Do you need something?

Sakuya:
Umm, there was something I wanted to ask you about.

Shinmyoumaru:
Hm? That blade...
There's no doubt about it. That's something I made into a tsukumogami as an experiment„Éº

Sakuya:
Huh? Wait, what?

Shinmyoumaru:
You brought it all the way here? Even humans are good for something.

Sakuya:
No, well, I, er...

Shinmyoumaru:
Thanks to the physical traits of the inchlings, no matter what we do, we're powerless.
There's almost nobody who wants to ally with us. We're just used, then thrown away.
I'm so glad you came all this way just to meet me...

Sakuya:
Excuse me, I am sorry to kill the mood,
but things just kind of led me here.

Shinmyoumaru:
Yes, I see. You've been led by your tool.
Now, won't you join me and turn the world upside-down?

Sakuya:
So you are complicit with the amanojaku (resistance) as well.
I am already aligned with another influential power.
Unfortunately for you, I have no intention to support rebels of any kind.

Shinmyoumaru:
Then why have you come all this way to where the knife led you?

Sakuya:
Well, because... For some reason, I just wanted to cut some youkai.

Shinmyoumaru:
A tool controlling its user to do its bidding.
The only thing that could make that possible is the power of our treasure, the "Miracle Mallet"!

Sakuya:
The Miracle Mallet... ...Wait, what!?

Shinmyoumaru:
That's right! It's the treasure that imparts the power of dreams to speechless tools!
Now, my treasured mallet! Lead this lost lamb to our resistance!

Sakuya:
So is this what lake cleaning is like?

???:
Hey, you!

Wakasagihime:
You're the one from that mansion on the bank...

Sakuya:
A half-fish person!?
I had no idea there was anything else besides fairies living around this dead lake.

Wakasagihime:
See? That's how it is.
You've long forgotten about the existence of us youkai!

Sakuya:
So there were creatures like her in the neighborhood.
I should take care when observing from now on.

Sakuya:
There are even youkai running amok this close to the Human Village...
It seems peace in Gensokyo is like the Tower of Babel upon sand.

???:
You showed up fast.

Sekibanki:
Have you come to exterminate me?

Sakuya:
Well, yes.
Since I received an order to pacify all the rampaging youkai.

Sekibanki:
It's useless. You've come too late.

Sekibanki:
The youkai have already begun to strike back!

Sekibanki:
Wh-What's with you? You're actually strong.

Sakuya:
Did I even once say that I was weak?

Sekibanki:
I really don't want to, but I guess I'll retreat for now...

Sakuya:
Yes, if you behave yourself, no one will hurt you.
...Except for the shrine maiden.

???:
You've come to exterminate me, haven't you?

Sakuya:
...how strange.
Do all of you want to be exterminated, perhaps?

Kagerou:
Do you think you can defeat me?

Sakuya:
Well, I was ordered to do so...

Kagerou:
The youkai's day in the sun, so to speak, has come at last.

Sakuya:
Really?

Kagerou:
How many years has it been since we were told to remain docile?
Enough is enough. Our time is now!

Sakuya:
Who should it be but a wolfman.

Kagerou:
I'm a wolf-woman!

Sakuya:
Ah, my apologies.
I often play pretend-wolfman at the mansion.

Kagerou:
Ah, so it seems my kind has some notoriety.
And you're... the vampire's maid?

Sakuya:
I often get to perform this impression:
"When a' see a full moon, a' transform!" 
......

Kagerou:
......
So, since I've lost, I guess I have to surrender unconditionally.

Sakuya:
Before you do that...
Do you know if there are other youkai running amok?

Kagerou:
Others? Well, I'm acting on my own.

Sakuya:
Huh?
Were you not conspiring with that mermaid, that rokurokubi and others?

Kagerou:
A conspiracy..? I took no part in any such thing.

Sakuya:
Hmm... So it is just by coincidence that you all became violent at once?
That seems rather hard to believe...

Sakuya:
All these eerie clouds suddenly turned up.
It certainly doesn't seem like a natural phenomenon.

???:
Wait a sec.

Yatsuhashi:
Why don't you fight with me?

Sakuya:
There are tsukumogami all the way up here?
All right. I detect something suspicious, so I accept.

Benben:
Now, now. That's my prey, you know.
Swiping her away is not very admirable behavior.

Yatsuhashi:
Hmmph! It's your fault for running away.
I saw you fighting her before, anyway.
Your plain, linear music won't work on her, big sis.

Sakuya:
Excuse me, could you save the sibling rivalry for later?
I can fight you both at once. It does not matter to me at all.

Yatsuhashi:
Hey... Could you stay out of this, Benben?
It's always been my dream to fight against a human and win, you know.

Benben:
Well, whatever. I'll just look for another opponent.
I'll leave the rest to you.

Sakuya:
That seemed too easy.

Yatsuhashi:
Well, our ultimate goal isn't to defeat you, after all.

Yatsuhashi:
The meek have gained power in this world of social upheaval.
Even mere tools can rule the world! I'll make you the foundation we'll stand on!

Yatsuhashi:
Whoa-ho„Éº
This person was strong...

Sakuya:
Your "ultimate goal" is to rule the world, then?

Yatsuhashi:
That's right! The preparations are already complete.

Sakuya:
Really?

Yatsuhashi:
I dunno why, but...
Even the youkai who've been docile up until now have received a strong power too.
That's the kind of world it's turning into.
If that's so, then docile tools would be the strongest of all, right?

Sakuya:
Tools? What in the world is happening?
Can you tell me more?

Yatsuhashi:
The inverted castle floating in the sky... That's where the source of our power is.

???:
What? What do you want?
This isn't a place for humans like you.
Leave at once!

Sakuya:
I heard that tools who come here could be granted power.
I would like to hear the details...

Seija:
Who is the one spreading all those silly rumors?
Well, it's not correct, but not wrong either. But...
That's all because of the "price".

Sakuya:
I heard that the youkai that were docile until now,
and even tools, have all been receiving power.

Seija:
I see... Even on the surface, changes are happening.
I need to investigate this "payment" some more...

Sakuya:
Argh, I do not have the time for this! Just tell me what you are plotting!

Seija:
Well, it should be okay to explain to a human.
We are a force of resistance. We will overturn society and re-draw the political borders of Gensokyo!
It doesn't have much to do with you, since you humans will end up under our heels.

Sakuya:
A resistance force!?
So what the koto said before about taking over the world was true.

Seija:
What do you say? If you understand, you should leave us be.
The new world will be more comfortable for humans, after all.

Sakuya:
Unfortunately, I am a human on the ruling side.
To me, a resistance force means a revolt against us.

Seija:
I see... That's a surprise.
None of you understand how much we, the weak,
have been oppressed. So...

Seija:
In this inverted castle where everything is turned upside-down, I'll give you a taste of the humiliation the weak have suffered!

Seija:
Ugh. How'd this happen?
Maybe my attempt was premature.

Sakuya:
I will show no mercy to those who want to plunge Gensokyo into chaos.
But I doubt you could do much anyway, considering your level of strength.

Seija:
Not yet. It's only just begun.
As long as we have that treasure, we can become as strong as we want.
...As long as we can turn a blind eye to the price.

Sakuya:
Ah...
Taking a rest and then fleeing was a wise choice on her part.
She also said "we", so this clearly is not the work of just one person.

Sakuya:
It seems dawn broke at some point and the storm also receded.
You could look down and see all of Gensokyo from here...

???:
Who's theeere?

???:
A human? Do you need something?

Sakuya:
I heard that there was a resistance force meeting here.

???:
My... So you're a supporter? A human supporter?
I'm so happy!

Shinmyoumaru:
Thanks to the physical traits of the inchlings, no matter what we do, we're powerless.
There's almost nobody who wants to ally with us. We're just used, then thrown away.
Even a human or a youkai joining our cause is great news.

Sakuya:
Umm, actually...
I am trying to stop that plot...

Shinmyoumaru:
If you're joining, I have to give you some power as well.
Should I give it to you? Or your knife?

Sakuya:
Hm? By "power"...
You mean the power to change a tool into a tsukumogami?

Shinmyoumaru:
That's right! That's what you came for, right?

Sakuya:
Hmm.

Shinmyoumaru:
Either way, you'll probably no longer be a human, though.

Sakuya:
I see I should just say it outright.
I am a human on the ruling side, so to me, resistance movements are treacherous.
I cannot support you in your endeavor.
Rather, I am here to subjugate you!

Shinmyoumaru:
Ahahaha! I see, you're on the ruling side... How unfortunate.
However, I have the power of dreams here in my hand.
This is our treasure, the "Miracle Mallet"!

Sakuya:
The Miracle Mallet... ...Wait, what!?

Shinmyoumaru:
I can see it. A future where the rulers and the ruled are reversed!
Now, my treasured mallet! Grant the power of dreams to those who are socially weak!

Benben:
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

Yatsuhashi:
Let the soul repose performance begin„Éº!

Reimu:
If those instrument tsukumogami from earlier are involved...
Surely this is the work of another instrument tsukumogami.

???:
You've finally come, shrine maiden of Hakurei.

???:
But you're too late now.

Reimu:
I was right, an instrument tsukumogami. My intuition has finally returned.
Unfortunately for you, though,
now that the Miracle Mallet is recovering its power, you'll go back to normal soon.

Raiko:
Really? And you thought your intuition had returned?
I can stay like this even without the Miracle Mallet.

Reimu:
Huh?

Raiko:
I noticed right away that the Miracle Mallet was the source of my power.
If I had just accepted that, I wouldn't be truly independent.
So I had a thought.
What if I discarded the Miracle Mallet's power and replaced it with a different magic...?
Then I told all the other tsukumogami about it.

Reimu:
You replaced it with a different magic? How did a mere tool figure that out...?

Raiko:
My, my. Tools would know better than anyone.
Because tools operate entirely through the magic of their users.
So, shall I test my new power on you?
Come, my drummer from the outside world! Let your primal beat echo throughout Gensokyo!

Raiko:
How surprising! I surrender„Éº

Reimu:
For a tool, that was quite a fight.
But you're not quite up to the level of a full-fledged youkai yet.

Raiko:
So I can't stand up to you using just magic from the outside world...
But that doesn't matter, since I learned I can fight quite a bit.

Reimu:
But a spell to replace your source of magic power...
I had no idea tsukumogami had that kind of cunning.

Raiko:
Everyone works hard to survive, right?
You can't call that "cunning".

Reimu:
By the way, what exactly is the magic you're using now?

Raiko:
The Magic Mallet was an exception, since its empowered objects on its own, but...
Originally, a tool's magic power is that of its user. Depending on the person using it, the magic changes.
So, possessed a drum that had floated in from the outside world.
The mystical power of a drummer from the outside world is what fills my soul. That's what the spell is.

Reimu:
Huh. I don't really get it, but it sounds convenient.
In any case, if they behave themselves, I... don't attack tools.

Raiko:
Oh, thank you very much. I won't defy you either, then.

Reimu:
Though I can't make any promises, since it depends on how the other youkai act.

Benben:
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

Yatsuhashi:
Let the soul repose performance begin„Éº!

Reimu:
Did the Miracle Mallet cause this storm, too?
What ominous power...

???:
You've finally come, shrine maiden of Hakurei.

???:
But you're too late now.

Reimu:
Too late for what?

Raiko:
I have obtained the magic to become independent.
I no longer require the powers of the Miracle Mallet.

Reimu:
What!?

Raiko:
Now we won't be bound to anyone. We are free!

Reimu:
I'm a little concerned about that power, but whatever.
If you're going to get violent, too, then I'll punish you right here!

Raiko:
The rumors were true.

Raiko:
The shrine maiden will just attack youkai out of the blue.
In other words, that's proof that I, a tool, have been acknowledged as a youkai.
Come, my drummer from the outside world! Engrave your beat into this very battle!

Raiko:
How surprising! I surrender„Éº

Reimu:
For a tool, that was quite a fight.
Man, whether it's the purification rod or whatever, a world where tools run around causing havoc is a big pain.

Raiko:
It is?

Reimu:
Well, of course! I had enough trouble just going out without it.
Tools should just settle for being used. If they can't even do that, then they're just garbage.

Raiko:
...I see. It must be painful being a tool.

Reimu:
Aren't you a tool, too?

Raiko:
I was!

Reimu:
I've learned that you should hold memorial services for tools that have become tsukumogami...
But with the purification rod thing, and since this is a special case...
If you behave yourselves, I might overlook it.

Raiko:
Why, thank you. I swear to never raise a ruckus around the shrine maiden.

Reimu:
...And other humans, too. All right?

Raiko:
Ah, wait.

Reimu:
What?

Raiko:
Please just let me raise a ruckus during concerts, okay?
The drummers in the outside world have a saying.
"Awaken your caveman spirit, for it doesn't need brains to beat a drum!"

Reimu:
Huh. ...The outside world seems barbaric.

Benben:
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

Yatsuhashi:
Let the soul repose performance begin„Éº!

Marisa:
Whew! The magical power has finally started to wane,
but this incident was really somethin'. I can't believe I was under the effects of my Mini-Hakkero.

???:
You've finally come, human magician.

???:
If you've come to seal me away, you're already too late.

Marisa:
Too late?

Raiko:
I have obtained the magic to become independent.
I no longer require the powers of the Miracle Mallet.

Marisa:
What? I see...
The magic vibe I get from you is definitely different from my Mini-Hakkero's.

Raiko:
I replaced the magic. So I don't have the power of the cursed Mallet now.

Marisa:
You replaced it? How could a tsukumogami like you use such high-level magic...

Raiko:
My, my. It's simple because I'm a tsukumogami.
Because when a tool's user changes, their magic power changes, too.
Now, shall we test out my new magical power?
Come, my drummer from the outside world! Let your once-in-a-lifetime beat resound!

Raiko:
How surprising! I surrender„Éº

Marisa:
Heh, you ain't bad at all. Ya got some scary magic there.
But, uh, is this magic from the outside world?

Raiko:
There are lots of skilled drummers in the outside world.
They even call them "taiko drum masters".

Marisa:
So the outside world has lots of different kinds of magic, too, huh? Cool.
Anyway, I really dug your groove.
If ya promise not to harm to humans, I won't exterminate ya now.

Raiko:
Really? I won't, I promise„Éº

Marisa:
...That was easy.

Raiko:
Well, I mean... I don't want to go back to being a tool!
I was never trying to cause trouble, I just wanted to move on my own.

Marisa:
Move on yer own...
I wonder if my Mini-Hakkero wants to do that, too.
Whoops, that was a close one. Better ditch the rest of that power now.

Benben:
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

Yatsuhashi:
Let the soul repose performance begin„Éº!

Marisa:
This is a pretty ominous storm.
This magic is on a whole different level from the stuff before.

???:
You've finally come, human magician.

???:
If you've come to seal me away, you're already too late.

Marisa:
Too late?
But the Magic Mallet's power has already run out.

Raiko:
Hehehe. I have obtained the magic to become independent.
I no longer require the powers of the Miracle Mallet.

Marisa:
What? So yer movin' usin' a different magic?
I see. In that case, there's no way I can just leave ya be.

Raiko:
Is that so?

Marisa:
I learned somethin' important from my Mini-Hakkero before.
When tools move on their own, it's a huge pain!
So the simple fact that yer moving on yer own makes ya a nuisance!

Raiko:
So what?
I already told you. If you want to seal me, it's too late.

Marisa:
I dunno what kinda magic yer using to move around, but I'm definitely not too late for some good ol' youkai extermination!

Raiko:
I wonder if you'll be able to say that once you hear my beat.
Come, my drummer from the outside world! Use your unknown pulse tonight to make my enemy "beat it"!

Raiko:
Ow, ow, ow! I surrender„Éº

Marisa:
You were pretty strong.
It's kinda scary to think somethin' this powerful could be born from a tool.

Raiko:
I still haven't mastered the outside world's magic...

Marisa:
The outside world's magic, huh. I couldn't master it either.
But anyway, I'll let you go without exterminatin' you.
...And not because I'm after the outside world's magic!

Raiko:
Oh, really? Then I'll just be on my way.
In the first place, we tsukumogami aren't here to cause trouble.
Though if our user is wicked, then we might end up making trouble...
And I don't have any memory of you using me, so...

Marisa:
So if your user is wicked, then you will make trouble...

Raiko:
What's wrong? Did you remember something?

Marisa:
Ah, no. Nothin' like that...
Man, I really need be careful with that Mini-Hakkero.

Benben:
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

Yatsuhashi:
Let the soul repose performance begin„Éº!

Sakuya:
I decided not to use this bewitched blade anymore, but...
Since I there are still youkai being affected by the Mallet's magic, I suppose I had no other choice.

???:
You've finally come, human maid.

???:
Even I have heard about the Miracle Mallet incident.

Sakuya:
Oh, I see.
Then you understand why I am here, yes?

Raiko:
You've come here to clean up the mess from the Mallet's magic power, right?
It's too late for that.

Sakuya:
Too late?

Raiko:
I no longer require the Miracle Mallet.
For I have replaced the cursed Mallet's power with a different magic.

Sakuya:
You replaced it? Tsukumogami can do that...?

Raiko:
My, my. It's simple because I'm a tsukumogami.
Because when a tool's user changes, their magic power changes, too.
Now, shall we test out my new magical power?
Come, my drummer from the outside world! Awaken primal emotions with your soul's beat!

Raiko:
How surprising! I surrender„Éº

Sakuya:
Wow, you were pretty tough.
Not the easily-exterminated type, I see.

Raiko:
I guess I still haven't mastered this new magic yet.

Sakuya:
By the way, you mentioned before that you replaced the magic power.

Raiko:
That's right, but it just means I've changed users.

Sakuya:
Just hypothetically,
If there was a blade that was desecrated by the Mallet's power and started causing problems...
If that blade changed hands, would that mean the magic power would be changed?

Raiko:
Hmm, let's see... If the user had a strong spirit, then probably.
But since the Mallet's magic is still intact, its magic could affect you.

Sakuya:
I-I was just speaking hypothetically.

Raiko:
I know you're hiding it. The blade in your hand... It's suffering.
...Would you like to hear more about how to release the magic power in it?

Sakuya:
Hmmm... Maybe I should?
No, I shall have to decline.

Raiko:
Oh, why?

Sakuya:
If it were to become a tsukumogami using my magic, it would become far too powerful...

Benben:
Sorry, but we're going to have to stop you right here.

Yatsuhashi:
Let the soul repose performance begin!

Sakuya:
The storm is clearly not natural.
Powerful magic is interfering with the atmosphere and causing a magical storm...!

???:
You've finally come, human maid.

Raiko:
Even I have heard about the Miracle Mallet incident.

Sakuya:
Oh, is that so?
You must be having a hard time in the middle of this storm.
I shall take the Mallet's magic back and return you to being a tool.

Raiko:
Too bad. Not a single part of me wants to return to being a mere tool.
And besides, you're too late anyway.

Sakuya:
Too late?

Raiko:
I have replaced the cursed Mallet's power with a different magic.
I no longer require the Miracle Mallet.

Sakuya:
You... replaced it? Tsukumogami can do that?

Raiko:
My, my. It's simple because I'm a tsukumogami.
Because when a tool's user changes, their magic power changes, too.
Now, shall we test out my new magical power?
Come, my drummer from the outside world! Let your visionary beat resound throughout Gensokyo!

Raiko:
How surprising! I surrender...

Sakuya:
Wow, you were pretty tough.
Not the easily-exterminated type, I see.

Raiko:
I guess I still haven't mastered this new magic yet.

Sakuya:
This new magic... I have a feeling I know, but what is it?

Raiko:
It's a drummer from the outside world. Strange power continues to flow through me.

Sakuya:
Oh, that is a perilous idea.
Interfering in the outside world could lead to problems...

Raiko:
Is that right? But things like borders don't mean anything to us tools.
We can come and go as we please.
Tools from the outside float here on their own all the time, don't they?

Sakuya:
Hmmm... Wait, since you are a tsukumogami now, that does not apply to you anymore, correct?

Raiko:
Oh. Maybe...

Sakuya:
What will you do? If you wish to return to being a tool, I shall help.

Raiko:
...No thanks! I'd very much not like to do that.
I don't want to go back to a life of being hit and stepped on.

Sakuya:
You are a drum, yes? How could you not want to be hit?

Narration:
The amanojaku Seija Kijin was gathering tools imbued with the power of the Miracle Mallet so she could overturn the world...

Narration:
But her plan was leaked, and order-respecting youkai began to target her...

Seija:
Shoot! Don't underestimate me, you weakling!

Seija:
Well, for such easy danmaku, I'll just dodge it and go back into hiding.

Yatsuhashi:
Ahaha! They said that whoever catches the amanojaku rebel will get a reward!

Seija:
...Don't underestimate me. A mere tool like you has no chance of catching me.

Yatsuhashi:
Huhuhu... They also said we're to use any means necessary against the rebel.

Yatsuhashi:
I'll give it a shot! Try and dodge this, my impossible spell card!

Seija:
What the hell!?

Seija:
If you're gonna start cheating, then I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, too!

Narration:
You're in a big pinch! But don't worry. Right now, you are carrying a mysterious tool that can get you through this danmaku.

Narration:
The current mysterious item you have equipped is the "Nimble Fabric"! When you press the Action Button, you'll become invincible for a certain amount of time!

Narration:
(Warning!) However, the period of invincibility is short, so use it when you're just barely about to touch the danmaku!

Narration:
Thanks to the mysterious item, you've managed to overcome this obstacle. But this is where the real tough part starts.

Narration:
The rumors of the girl who planned a rebellion have spread all throughout Gensokyo. An endless amount of youkai will come after her to take her prisoner.

Narration:
For the next few days, the assassins will attack with impossible spell cards that ignore the rules! There's no need to hold back. Use your own cheat items to your heart's content and you'll pull through!

Narration:
One last thing... You can change your equipped item on the menu screen! Choose the item you like the best.

Kagerou:
I've found you! The wanted amanojaku.

Seija:
Gah, have the rumors already spread this far?

Kagerou:
There's been an official notice to attack with all your might using impossible spell cards.

Seija:
Who is it? The one who sent out that notice...

Seija:
It's frustrating, but I don't have a choice. I guess I'll have to use these mysterious items that I set aside.

Narration:
You're now able to use new mysterious items! The one that is currently equipped is the "Bloodthirsty Yin-Yang Orb." When you press the button, you'll "warp directly in front of the boss!"

Raiko:
You don't know when to give up, do you? Why don't you quietly give up and be caught?

Seija:
Ah? What, so it's a tsukumogami.

Seija:
In the first place, the fact that you've managed to get freedom like this

Seija:
was because I unleashed the power of the mallet, right?

Seija:
Though you should be indebted to me, isn't it weird for you to get in my way?

Raiko:
It's the opposite, really.

Raiko:
It's because I know about the mallet's power that I'm going to capture you.

Raiko:
The tools are crying because of the way you use it so recklessly.

Seija:
...You're acting self-important when you're just a tool.

Raiko:
Since you're just using tools for these impossible spell cards,

Raiko:
I'll push you down with pure danmaku power!

Raiko:
Try and dodge this without any trickery!

Seija:
How stupid.

Seija:
I only have these hard-to-use items left... But there are items that are perfect for times like these.

Narration:
You're now able to use new mysterious items! The one that is currently equipped is the "Substitute Jizo." Nothing will happen if you press the button, but it'll "automatically keep you from dying!"

Seija:
Is it still not over yet?

Mamizou:
Oy, the amanojaku over there.

Mamizou:
It's better if you gave up now.

Seija:
I dunno who you are but I sincerely refuse.

Mamizou:
The tengu (reporters) are already on the move.

Mamizou:
Once it's in the papers, it won't be long before those guys that are slow to start get moving.

Mamizou:
...Well, though this doesn't really concern me,

Mamizou:
It doesn't seem like you're not fully drawing out the power of those items...

Seija:
Whaddya mean by that?

Mamizou:
You're leaving one hand idle, aren't you? If you equipped them in both hands... then maybe.

Seija:
Both hands... she says?

Narration:
While still only half-convinced, she put the "Bloodthirsty Yin-Yang Orb' in her open hand. And then look! Wasn't there a small amount of magical power flowing in?

Narration:
Now, in addition to your equipped item, you can also equip the "Bloodthirsty Yin-Yang Orb". And with that, your "hitbox becomes much smaller!"

Shinmyoumaru:
Hey, Seija.

Shinmyoumaru:
Isn't it about time for you to give them back? The mallet's remaining power, that is.

Seija:
Eh? What are you talking about? It's only just begun‚Äîthe true social upheaval.

Shinmyoumaru:
Uhhh... Unfortunately...

Shinmyoumaru:
Upheaval is impossible at this point. We've already lost this fight.

Seija:
Even if you complain...

Seija:
There's nothing to worry about. As long as we have at least this much cheating power,

Seija:
We can put the youkai throughout Gensokyo under our control at any time.

Shinmyoumaru:
It's all right, it's all right, now.

Shinmyoumaru:
Let's just surrender. I'm not going to antagonize the youkai of Gensokyo.

Seija:
I appreciate the offer, but...

Seija:
Nope! I ain't surrendering to nobody.

Shinmyoumaru:
Well, I figured you'd say that.

Shinmyoumaru:
In that case, I'll make you return that power to me!

Shinmyoumaru:
By the way, in case you were going to resist~

Shinmyoumaru:
I told e-very-one to seriously try and capture you.

Shinmyoumaru:
Like the saying, "A live dog is better than a dead lion," right?

Seija:
No matter who's after my life, I have no reason to return this wonderful power.

Seija:
For I am Seija An amanojaku since birth!

Seija:
Whatever the means, whoever survives, wins.

Seija:
I survived 'cause they're all just weaklings. I should find a place to hide soon.

Seija:
They're following me to a place like this... I still have some trump cards up my sleeve, but still...

Seija:
Ugh, they're getting stronger. Maybe I should try leveling up my new items, too...

Seija:
Ugh, guess I've got no choice. Time to get serious.

Seija:
Are there no good hiding places above ground? What about over here?

Seija:
Gah, is this because of that newspaper? In that case, then I'll go to the other world!

Seija:
Okay, that does it! This isn't the time to run away or hide, I'll make enemies out of them all!

Seija:
Outta the way! The (soon to be) great Amanojaku is passing through!

Seija:
If I beat these guys, I'll have nothing more to fear. I will become the new ruler!

Marisa:
I found somethin' real interestin' here at Kourindou.
Looks like nobody's noticed this phenomenon yet.
Better act now an' take this power (thing) for my own!

Marisa:
O-oh, uh, hi. What're ya up to at this hour?

Reimu:
Well, I found something kind of interesting...
...and figured I could test it out on Marisa (you) .

Marisa:
"Test it out," huh? That doesn't sound too friendly.
But I've got somethin', too! Ya came at just the right time.
Time to cut loose an' test this out on ya! Behold this mysterious (occult) power!

:
Spell Cards and Grazing
When dashing or leaping up & down, you'll erase bullets you touch. This effect is called "grazing"!
You can open paths through strong enemy Spell Cards by dashing in. Leap into the danmaku with a good, strong dash!

Reimu:
When I said 'test out', I actually meant having you be my guinea pig (taste these mushrooms) ...
Just what are you trying to show me by attacking me all of a sudden? Don't tell me you're already finished, are you?

Marisa:
‚ÄõCourse not!
Have a taste a' this! A new way to use the Urban Legends (occult) !

:
Occult Spells and Occult Balls
When an Occult Ball appears, the enemy's using a "Weird Spell".
This is a foul-play type situation; an attack that's more ferocious than a Spell Card, and your attacks barely have any effect. Yikes!
The weak point you should aim for is the "Occult Ball".
By being in continual contact with the ball, you can steal it and put a stop to the Weird Spell!

:
Ultimate Arcanum: Weird Last Word
With 4 or more Occult Balls, you can use your "Weird Last Word" by pressing both the Special Move and Spell Card buttons at once. It uses all the Balls, but the more you have, the harder it hits!
Try hitting Marisa with it, quick.

Marisa:
Behold, behold! These are the seven mysteries of the school!

Marisa:
Welp. That's it, I guess.
Isn't it cool, though? We can freely control the urban legends.

Reimu:
W-well, I certainly realized that much.
But what was that bizarre ball a second ago...?

Marisa:
Beats me.

Kasen:
I see, I see. So Marisa's also acquired a ball...

Reimu:
Marisa, "also"?

Kasen:
Oh, just kidding, sorry. What were we talking about?

Reimu:
Hmf. It's no use playing dumb.
I thought you would know something about the Urban Legends (make-believe) . Looks like I was right.

Kasen:
That urban legend being... "If you collect the seven Occult Balls...

Kasen  Reimu:
...your wish is granted," right?
"...a huge incident occurs," right.

Kasen  Reimu:
Eh?
Hm?

Reimu:
Eh, whatever. So when Marisa used this weird move, this weird ball appeared too.
I would think that ball was one of the rumored Occult Balls...
Although, in the first place, I dunno if someone just spread that rumor by as some kind of Urban Legend (make-believe) ...

Kasen:
If your story about Marisa is true, then...
You're the one holding that Occult Ball right now.

Reimu:
Hm?

Kasen:
My apologies... But I'll be taking that ball here and now!

Kasen:
These Occult Balls exist for unknown reasons. It's hard to imagine Reimu being the culprit, but... Well, anyway, that was a close one...

Kasen:
Well, I figured as much. You're not going to hand it over that easily?
(Using my full strength here would be risky for several reasons... I ought to at least warn her, though.)

Reimu:
What was that!? You pulled out some weird ball, too!
Don't tell me it's just like the rumor said...?

Kasen:
Reimu, this ball is dangerous. It isn't a rumor that someone fabricated.
This ball alone isn't some Urban Legend (make-believe) ! Most likely, this is legitimately A Great Incident (occult) !

Reimu:
Geeze, thanks to all that weird stuff she was saying...
I'm too intrigued to sleep.

Reimu:
Who's there? On a night like this...?
...........
No reaction. Meaning there's nobody in front of me.
Oh dear, I must be sleeping after all. This is just a dream...
...or rather, not! Not with this occult aura! Better strike before they do...!

Marisa:
So then what happened?
With the shadow person shrouded in an occult aura.

Reimu:
Hmmm.
I don't quite remember, honestly.

Marisa:
So wasn't it just a dream then?

Reimu:
Hmmm...?

Marisa:
Sure is a shame, though. If only it had been me, I woulda captured 'em alive.

Reimu:
Huh?

Marisa:
Anyway. Gimme my ball back.

Reimu:
What? What's this about a ball...?

Marisa:
Don't play dumb. You know the shadow person showed up 'cause of that thing!
I'll be taking on this investigation!

Reimu:
My memories since meeting the shadow person have been really vague...

Marisa:
That's weird.
I was so sure you'd have all seven of 'em.

Reimu:
Well, I don't. Speaking of which, the one I stole from you vanished at some point as well.

Marisa:
Hmm... Just what is goin' on here?

Marisa:
My nose is tellin' me there's an Occult Ball around here.
...an' aside from the ball, I smell treasure too! Since it's a treasure ship.

Ichirin:
Can I help you?

Marisa:
Whoops. Here comes trouble.

Ichirin:
So it appears you really are a thief by trade?

Marisa:
...Huh? Is it just me, or d'you seem kinda different?

Ichirin:
Oh my, has the radiating ways of my enlightened self been revealed?

Marisa:
Naw, naw. There's this creepy aura surrounding you. You stink of the occult.

Ichirin:
It's like I've been possessed by a new nyuudou lately.

Marisa:
So you really did have a ball, huh?

Ichirin:
Ouch, ouch, ouch...
Just as I was thinking I'd been possessed by something... What was up with that ball just now?

Marisa:
No worries. I ain't got no clue either.

Marisa:
Looks like I've searched most of the surface, so could be that the last few're underground.

Koishi:
Hello, hello!

Marisa:
Although, could the urban legends really be spreading all the way underground?

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Where do you think I am right now?

Marisa:
Since there's zero human traffic down here, rumors might not spread...
In the first place, stylish stuff like urban legends really don't suit the rabble down here.

Koishi:
Hello, hello!

Marisa:
What's this I've been hearing? What's making that sound?
What if this could be yet another kind of urban legend?

Koishi:
Hello, hello! I'm, you know...
Standing right in front of you.

Koishi:
By the way, what did you come here for?

Marisa:
Geez, that startled me. Don't just jump out like that.
If you were just some youkai, I wouldn't care, but I've got no idea what's going on right now, y'see.

Koishi:
What was that ball just now?

Marisa:
Don't you worry about it. I dunno either.
With this, I oughta have all seven... but what's gonna happen?

Koishi:
Just when did I get ahold of that, I wonder?

Marisa:
Welp, It's already nighttime and I still dunno how to use 'em!
My predictions were off. If I just gathered them according to the rumor, I figured something would happen, but...
Maybe I really do need a spell or something.
Oh, god of the occult! Grant me like a wish or somethin', will ya!
.....

Kasen:
What are you doing at this hour?

Marisa:
Oh, well, you know.
Nothin' happened even after I gathered the balls, so I thought I might need like a spell or something.

Kasen:
Wait, did you perhaps find all the Occult Balls?

Marisa:
Y-yeah. Dunno how to use 'em though.

Kasen:
That's ridiculous.
Reimu was attacked only just yesterday, right?
Do you have some kind of power that identifies occult balls?

Marisa:
I got a good nose.

Kasen:
......
This isn't what I came here to do, but let's begin.

Marisa:
Huh?

Kasen:
"In the name of the sage XXXX, I command: Release the ban of 130 years."

Kasen:
As such, the countdown has begun.
Surely, you ain't so foolish as to not understand what you ought to do.

Marisa:
What, what? What the hell's goin' on?

Kasen:
If you do not intend to understand, even you will simply be eliminated.

Marisa:
This is for real, right? Still dunno what's up though.

Kasen:
This is a test. Naturally, if you're too weak, you'll just die.

Marisa:
Ah, gotcha. Nothin' to be scared of, then.
What you're doing right now's what I understand.

Kasen:
Is that all you've got? Looks like I'll have to go myself, then.

Kasen:
That's enough. You ought to do fine.

Marisa:
Hey, explain yourself. Just what's going on?

Kasen:
You've gotten yourself caught in a trap. One that was completed only just yesterday, at that.

Marisa:
Is this about the Occult Balls?

Kasen:
After investigating, I've concluded that the Occult Balls are akin to a key to undo the barrier; they're scientific, artificial matter.
They're created with matter from the outside world, and have energy from outside.

Marisa:
H-hmm. And if you gather 'em?

Kasen:
Whoever collects them all will become a new key to break the barrier from the inside, and will break the barrier as they're sent outside.
The rumor about collecting all the balls was a prohibited rumor that someone fed us.

Marisa:
Hmm, I see... wait, what?

Kasen:
And you've been caught in that very trap.
The balls hold an unknown power so I can't do anything about them on my own.

Marisa:
...So, you're sayin' that at any moment now I'm gonna hafta say so long to Gensokyo?
Speakin' of, my vision has been wavering a bit...

Kasen:
Mm-hm. Don't worry, though.
Just now, I was testing your strength as the first one to make a move.

Marisa:
Which means...?

Kasen:
Before the trap snaps shut and the barrier is broken, I'm sending you to the outside world myself!
Find the enemy out there, and defeat them! Know that if you fail, death alone awaits!

???:
Well, it was only yesterday, so nothing's happened yet, right?
I was really surprised yesterday, though. I can't believe I got attacked by a shrine maiden all of a sudden...

Marisa:
Ow, ow, ow.
It's so bright here, my eyes are startin' to sting.
I can only be on the Outside (here) for about half an hour's what I think she sa-... Huh?

???:
Yay, I got one, I got one!
The fact that you're flying means you're not human, right?

Marisa:
I'm definitely human.

???:
Human...?

Marisa:
An' for that matter... who are you? A human from outside?
Or rather, you're the one. The one who stuck me in that trap.

???:
Indeed.
I meant to introduce myself sooner.
I'm Sumireko Usami, first-year student at Higashifukami High. A real-life psychic who silences crying children.

Marisa:
By "High" you mean that, right? A school, right?

Sumireko:
Yes? Do you not have them on your side?

Marisa:
Hey, you know any spooky school stories? They're so exciting.

Sumireko:
Um, I do, but... More importantly, I want to hear more of your stories.
Seeing as the reason I called you out here was because I wanted to learn about Gensokyo.

Marisa:
"Called me out here", you say?

Sumireko:
You see, I can actually enter your world, even if only a little bit.
It was such a beautiful world.
So, I want to expose all its secrets. Even if I run into a bit of danger.

Marisa:
...So, the barrier's exposed to danger even on outside, huh?
There's lots of stuff I wanna ask you, but I don't have any more time.

Marisa:
The name's Marisa Kirisame. A real-life magician.
I'm just doing my job here, is all.

Sumireko:
...Yes, I'm well aware of the job of Gensokyo's youkai.

Marisa:
I'm human.

Sumireko:
This is the sort of work you do, right?

Marisa:
Yeah. Looks like you're a smart one.
Kinda feels unfair fighting against a normal human, though...

Sumireko:
You ought to watch out, yourself. Seeing as even a high-school girl can make her own weapons these days...

Marisa:
What's a "hai-skool gurl"?

Sumireko:
Allow me to inform you, miss visitor from another world.
It's the strongest, most invincible kind of creature in the entire outside world!

Sumireko:
Well then! Let's start by just being friends, shall we?

Kasen:
I see. So when you came to, that enigmatic figure had disappeared?

Reimu:
Maybe I was just dreaming or something...

Kasen:
By the way, where's the Occult Balls?

Reimu:
Those things I stole from you and Marisa?
Now that you mention it, those ones are gone. I was thinking I may as well collect all seven, too...

Kasen:
Don't collect them. ...just behave yourself for right now, please. Now isn't a good time.

Reimu:
?

Kasen:
That aside, I'll keep your own Occult Ball safe for now, too.

Reimu:
Maybe I'll collect all seven, after all.

Reimu:
Well, here you go, I guess. This thing's honestly kind of creepy.

Kasen:
Let me give you a warning. Under no circumstances should you collect all seven.

Reimu:
Huh? Why?

Kasen:
It'll just end up giving you more work to do.

Kasen:
Well, this is troubling. I can't find Marisa anywhere.
I'm sure she's off collecting the balls once again, though.

Futo:
Oh, bist thee the hermit from the mountain, art thou not?

Futo:
F'r what purpose art thou led hither?

Kasen:
Well, I'm looking for someone at the moment... huh? There's an occult aura around you too?
You haven't come into contact with anything related to horror stories lately, have you?

Futo:
There is none in particular. I suppose counting mine plates hath become part of daily routine, yet nary be there any connection, I am sure.
And as many times I count, one art missing. I can only ever find nine.

Kasen:
Yep, that's it.

Futo:
Withal, one plate doth be missing.

Kasen:
Okiku-san is yet another classic.

Futo:
What is this? What on earth just betid?

Kasen:
No need to worry about it. I'm just doing my job.

Kasen:
It seems that everyone's somehow been obtaining the balls unconsciously.
Maybe I need to reconsider the conditions for someone to gain possession of the ball?
Perhaps I should gather information around here.
Although, since I've already got two of the balls, I have no doubt I'll be able to collect all seven.

Kokoro:
Hey, am I pretty?

Kasen:
Oh, you're that noh performer from back then...

Kokoro:
I'm asking you a question. Am I pretty?

Kasen:
Mmm. You don't look bad, I guess?

Kokoro:
Heh heh heh. Am I still pretty even now!?

Kokoro:
Ohhh, my jaw is tired.

Kasen:
I can hardly believe there was a ball here too.

Kokoro:
I'm not pretty after all...

Kasen:
Even if someone's trying to tear it out of your mouth, I think it's better not to say that sort of thing.

Kasen:
Oh. Hm. Looks like I failed...
Right after I can't find Marisa anywhere, it turns out that she already got seven too. Honestly.
I didn't expect there to be more than seven balls, either.
When they said "collect seven balls," I kind of assumed there were only those seven.

Mamizou:
My, what do we have here?

Kasen:
Oh, crap. I've been spotted.

Mamizou:
Just what would you be doing around here, hmm?

Kasen:
......

Mamizou:
If you're clamming up, I imagine you're not planning on anything good.

Kasen:
Obviously.
If you've already found me, I've got no choice. I'll make you behave yourself by force.

Mamizou:
When I'm here, I can feel that nostalgic air.

Mamizou:
I give, I give. You beat me.

Kasen:
If you just keep quiet about this, I won't do anything else.

Mamizou:
I'm familiar with the feeling in this space. This is the wind of the outside world.
You opened up a hole in the barrier, didn't you?

Kasen:
Hoh... So you're saying you won't keep quiet?

Mamizou:
Woah, nelly. No need to get so defensive, there.
I'm aware of Gensokyo's rules, but I'm still a youkai who came from outside.
If you're headin' to some other world, I won't raise any fuss.

Kasen:
I'll be heading to the outside world, now. ...my reason for doing so is a secret, of course.

Mamizou:
That so, that so. It's all fine by me. How's about I tidy things up here at the shrine, then?

Kasen:
I'll be back right away. It shouldn't take more than three days.

Mamizou:
I'll be lookin' forward to a souvenir, too. The igo seaweed in Sado is real nice.

Kasen:
As usual, this place really does not agree with me.
My clothes have gotten dirty, so I suppose I should get this over with quickly.

Kasen:
Who's there? Marisa?

Sumireko:
Woah, there. I finally got ahold of someone non-human, I hope?
Hooray! This is a huge success.

Kasen:
Goodness, there are really people who can fly in the outside world?

Sumireko:
Well, I'm a special case.

Kasen:
I see. Are you the mastermind who set up the Occult Balls?
I can't believe you were trying to break Gensokyo's barrier with those things. You must be very fearless.

Sumireko:
Yep, looks like I got found out right away. I got great results out of it, though.
The plan was that if someone collected seven of the balls according to the rumour,
it'd create a door that allows one to freely enter and exit the world over there. It's that kind of process.

Kasen:
...you even know that much...? Just what are you?

Sumireko:
Allow me to introduce myself again. I'm Sumireko Usami, first-year student at Higashifukami High. A real-life psychic who silences crying children.

Kasen:
Wait, could you possibly be... human?
I never imagined that a human from outside would try to break down Gensokyo's barrier.

Sumireko:
You shouldn't underestimate humans these days.
One can find just about anything by searching on the net, after all!

Kasen:
That aside, though, it looks like I've arrived at the answer sooner than Marisa.
I came over here on some other business, but...
Now that I'm here, I may as well save Gensokyo from this crisis too.

Sumireko:
Hey, now. I know all about Gensokyo's youkai, you know?
You solve all your problems with pure firepower.

Kasen:
Ah. You even know that, and you're still holding your ground?

Sumireko:
Do you think that classical, behind-the-times youkai like yourselves can stand up to this era's humans and their collective knowledge?

Kasen:
Humans truly have become foolish.
Have you forgotten the enigmatic terror of the youkai?
Have you forgotten the mind-numbing darkness of the night?

Sumireko:
There's nothing to fear from the mysterious. In this day and age, even children can make whole collections of youkai.
Know the power of human intelligence. And thus...
Lament the small, narrow world that you've been shut inside!

Sumireko:
Huuh? The door's hasn't opened yet?

Ichirin:
Hey, hey! You've got a ball, right? Gimme, gimme!

Futo:
That ought to mean, you posses a ball as well?
Very well! I will accept the challenge?

Futo:
My Urban Legend (occult) is Okiku-san. Tremble in fear!

Ichirin:
Heh heh, Okiku-san? That's so dated!
Of course you got Okiku-san!

Futo:
I think she's plenty stylish, though, Okiku-san...

Ichirin:
When it comes to the Urban Legends (occult) , newer means stronger, obviously!

Futo:
Ugh. This time I shall I concede the victory.

Ichirin:
Where should I go next?

Ichirin:
Oh, Ms. Marisa!
Thanks to our fight, I've awakened to the joy of collecting balls.
I've already gathered four.

Marisa:
Hmm. Oh, really?

Ichirin:
We shall be having a match today too, no?
Even if it gets stolen, it comes back somehow if I just wait a bit, anyway.

Marisa:
You really oughta take it easy, playing with the balls.
Well, that's what I came here today to tell you, but it seems like you won't be listening anyway.

Ichirin:
I'm glad you understand. Let's go!

Marisa:
So you've gotten another ball again...

Ichirin:
That really wasn't much of a fight.
It wasn't like you, either.

Marisa:
Well, I'm just not feelin' it right now.
Anyhow, just two more to go, huh? For you, that is.

Ichirin:
I wonder who has the last two?

Marisa:
Hmm, there's another one way up in the sky. That's what my nose tells me.

Ichirin:
In the sky...? Why are you telling me though?

Marisa:
Not sure myself.
I guess I just wanna see what'll happen when you gather 'em all.

Ichirin:
When you say "in the sky", this place becomes suspicious.
It's been bothering me for a while now: why is this castle upside down? Construction defect?

Shinmyoumaru:
Hey, you, you've got lotsa Occult Balls, right?

Ichirin:
Hmph. Who's asking?

Shinmyoumaru:
I am a descendant of the proud inchling race. Come, and humbly do battle with me!

Ichirin:
Inchlings? I had no idea...

Shinmyoumaru:
If you're going to underestimate me just because I'm small, you're seriously going to get hurt!

Ichirin:
*giggle* I wonder what kind of Urban Legend (occult) an inchling would use.

Shinmyoumaru:
What's so funny?

Ichirin:
I was just thinking that "tiny things are cute"...
After all, I use an urban legend that's eight shaku tall.

Shinmyoumaru:
I-if you think bigger means better, then you're sorely mistaken!
Realize the terror that is becoming the plaything of the small!

Shinmyoumaru:
Weak! So big but so weak!

Ichirin:
Whew, I finally beat you!
I guess bigger really is better. I'll be taking that ball!

Shinmyoumaru:
Take it, you thief!
*sob sob* I can't believe I lost!
The rumor said that if I gathered seven balls I could get big and everything!

Ichirin:
What kind of super-specific rumor is that?
Honestly, what are the Occult Balls really, anyway?

Shinmyoumaru:
My plan was to wait for someone to gather six balls and steal them all at once, but...
I guess whoever's holding lots of balls must be pretty strong... I miscalculated.

Ichirin:
You really sound like a sore loser. A loser's excuses always sound so miserable!

Shinmyoumaru:
Actually, I know who has the last ball, but I guess you don't want me to tell you.

Ichirin:
I'm sorry. Though your body is small, your spirit is truly great.

Shinmyoumaru:
Hmph. Well, it doesn't matter to me which one of you gets them all.
Allow me to tell you!
The remaining balls are in the hands of that pompous hermit. She's gotten six of them too.

Ichirin:
Huh? I thought there were only seven of them?

Shinmyoumaru:
She's tough, though? You're no match for her, probably!

Miko:
I say, so it appears you've been gathering the Occult Balls as well.

Ichirin:
Out of everyone, the last one is you? That's rough... This is definitely gonna be some seriously nasty Urban Legend (occult) , ugh.

Miko:
Incidentally, do you realize what these balls are?

Ichirin:
Once you gather seven of them, you attain enlightenment. They are balls coveted by monks.

Miko:
Ha ha ha! You've been led around by such an idiotic rumor?
You fool! These things are nothing like that! As if gathering them could ever lead to enlightenment.

Ichirin:
Whaaat?

Miko:
Once the urban legends started spreading around, I decided to look into the origins of each and every rumor.
And what did I find? Why, that most of them were spread by those near the shrine.

Ichirin:
Really, is that so?

Miko:
I imagine they were taking measures to render the materialized urban legends harmless.
By skillfully manipulating the rumors, they would prevent danger before it occurs.
But the Occult Balls alone are different.
I wasn't able to find the source of the rumors about them.

Miko:
However, I staked out the shrine for several days, and suddenly the truth revealed itself.

Ichirin:
Oh? Go on.

Miko:
I could only see her shadow, but it was unmistakably...

Miko:
A human from outside! These balls are from the Outside World!

Ichirin:
What!?
...Or, couldn't you just have guessed as much?
I mean, don't the urban legends we're all using only come from the Outside World?

Miko:
My, that's quite observant of you.
So, knowing that, you still chose to gather the balls?
Heh heh heh, very well then.
If you have no fear of the unknown, I shall be your opponent.
Let us wager all of the Occult Balls! But the one who gets their hands on them could find themselves in quite an unfortunate situation!

Miko:
I'm more suit to posses the balls than you.

Byakuren:
Say, Ichirin.
I've also obtained an interesting power.

Ichirin:
Then, that means... You're finally going to use one of these urban legends as well.

Byakuren:
Hm-hm-hm. It's the strongest and fastest urban legend of them all.
Mind if I join the ride?

Ichirin:
Seems like you haven't gotten the hang of it.

Byakuren:
I see. So this is the rumoured Occult Ball...

Ichirin:
What do you think? Gathering 7 of them will make you attain enlightenment, they said.

Byakuren:
Really now? This is one troublesome artifact.

Futo:
How fortunate for me that thou showed thyself now! Let us wager our balls and fight!

Byakuren:
Yes, yes. I'll take you on.
It seems I won't understand anything without gathering them all first, after all.

Futo:
Dost thou think thou willst get the best of me? Gaze upon mine Occult and tremble in fear!

Futo:
I'm one plate shooort. Well, aren't thou scared?

Byakuren:
I'll be taking this, then.
At the rate I'm going, gathering the balls themselves should be easy enough.

Futo:
...*sniff* *sniff* I've feared bringing one less plate will have its comeuppance.

Byakuren:
Why did you pick such a tragic Occult in the first place?

Nitori:
You came just at the right time.
We're stocking up on Occult Balls today.

Byakuren:
As I thought, the urban legends even reached all the way to the Kappa society.

Nitori:
Heh heh heh. Don't underestimate us.
No way we're going to rely on urban legends originating from such baseless rumours.
We've created a machine based on an urban legend. Now nobody can deny the power of this thing!

Byakuren:
Ummm... Then that's just a weapon......

Nitori:
I'll say it once more! Today, we're stocking up on Occult Balls!

Nitori:
Awright, ball GET! This one will sell for a fortune!

Byakuren:
I thought you wouldn't have an Occult Ball, and yet here we are.

Nitori:
Huuh? A ball came out of me, too?

Byakuren:
So it's true that even those who possess it can't fully control them.
I've realized, from the moment I held onto this ball...
That this is the beginning of a nightmare.

Mokou:
Who goes there?

Mokou:
Wait, aren't you from the Myouren Temple...?
What's your business here?

Byakuren:
I felt a strong aura coming from you that's similar to these balls, so I came here to check.

Mokou:
You too, huh.

Byakuren:
"Too"?

Mokou:
It's been pissing me off lately.
People keep coming here, asking me to hand over the ball.
But seriously, what ball? I told them I don't have any, but it was useless.

Byakuren:
You don't have one?
But that Occult aura is definitely...

Mokou:
What is this Occult aura you're talking about? Spare me those alien terms.

Byakuren:
Hmm, let's see. In the first place, do you have any interest in the rumours spreading among the humans?

Mokou:
I've long stopped concerning myself with the matters of this fleeting world.

Byakuren:
So you don't know about the urban legends?

Mokou:
Urban legends? What's that?

Byakuren:
I see. I'm amazed you manage to stay so clueless of the happenings around you.
Still, I am certain that I sensed the presence of an Occult Ball from you.

Byakuren:
It seems there are certain occasions where it attaches itself to people without them realizing.

Mokou:
Well, nevermind that. In the end, you want to wager that ball through a fight, right?
That's how it was with the people that came before you.
It's not like I'll ever die anyway, so no need to hold back!

Mokou:
I missed out on death again.

Byakuren:
You've gathered quite a lot of these balls.
Ah, yes, you got them after defeating your challengers...

Mokou:
Pheew. It feels like some burden got off my shoulders. I give you my thanks.

Byakuren:
The fact that it can manifest without the person's knowledge...
Now I'm completely certain. This is nothing but a bad omen.
It's a wonder that people can enjoy this as a simple competition for balls.

Miko:
I figured that you'll be my last opponent.

Byakuren:
I heard that you're also gathering these balls.
What is your goal?

Miko:
Asking questions right off the bat? Well, it matters not.
Did you think I'm gathering these balls out of an obsession over some petty rumours?

Byakuren:
Of course I don't. That's what makes me worried.
After all, these balls are formed from idle curiosity and deep secrets.

Miko:
Curiosity and deep secrets, hm...? Very typical of you to see it like that.
This is an artifact from the outside world. There must be someone outside who's planning to use these for some purpose here in Gensokyo.
If that person holds curiosity towards Gensokyo, then nothing good will come of it.

Byakuren:
The Outside World... is it? Now I understand why there's so many unknown things regarding its true nature.

Miko:
That's why I decided to set out and gather them myself, so I could study them.
Well, that's my answer. How about yours? What's your reason to gather these balls?

Byakuren:
As for me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I'm gathering them all to seal them, so these urban legends won't be used for evil.

Miko:
Seal them? Oh yeah, putting a lid over anything you deem rotten is what your folks specialize in.

Miko:
Don't make me laugh.
These urban legends spread themselves naturally through rumours.
You can't put a lock on people's mouths, can you?
Anyway, it seems like there's no way to get these Occult Balls without a fight.
Also, through this fight, we can decide which ideology is right. Yours or mine.

Byakuren:
It can't be helped. You are after all, too wise for your own good.
I can't let such a person wield this power of nightmares!

Miko:
Now they're all in my possession.

Futo:
I beseech thee!
I came to steal the Occult Ball!

Ichirin:
Perfect, just what I wanted.

Ichirin:
You've got some guts, challenging me.

Futo:
I attacked because it looked like it would be easy to steal here.
A good place for a warm-up.

Ichirin:
"Anyone who sees my true form won't be leaving this place alive"... right?

Futo:
That was simple. I am taking the Occult Ball.

Ichirin:
Crap, I lost to someone so behind the times like her?

Futo:
What couldst thou be talking about? Is not Okiku-san the pinnacle of high culture?

Futo:
The Crown Prince should be going after the strong-looking people, so...
Who should I take a ball from next?

Futo:
Oh? If it isn't Reimu.
Thy timing is impeccable. Shall we wager our Occult Balls and fight?

Reimu:
Ah... sure.
Since I'm looking into the Occult Balls right now.

Reimu:
Oh, great, I got another one. I was trying to get rid of it this time, too.

Futo:
Huzzah, I have obtained a new ball!
Couldst thou have been going easy on me?

Reimu:
O-Of course not.
More importantly, do you want to know who has all the remaining balls?

Futo:
Oh? Why wouldst thou tell me something like that?

Reimu:
It seems like it'd be better for me to keep an eye on the balls rather than gather them myself...

Mokou:
Looks like we have another lost child today...

Mokou:
Who are you?

Futo:
I beseech thee. Let's wager our balls and fight!

Mokou:
*sigh*

Futo:
What is't?

Mokou:
This is about the Occult Balls again? Lately lots of people have been telling me to hand 'em over.
Of course, I beat 'em all at their own game.
You must be insane to challenge an immortal.

Futo:
Oho, so might thou be an immortal as well?

Mokou:
What? Don't tell me you're also...

Futo:
I am a person who hath experienced death once before.

Mokou:
Hehehe, well that's a shocker. How interesting.
I accept your challenge! Let's have a match to see which of us dies first!

Futo:
Er, no, just betting the Occult Balls is fine, thanks.

Mokou:
I keep saying I don't need any balls, but they just keep piling up.

Futo:
Huzzah, I've gotten more balls!
...wait, thou wert holding this many?

Mokou:
Ah, that's because I kept defeating the people who challenged me.
It's kinda refreshing to get rid of 'em all.

Futo:
That was simple. With this, I have six.
Reimu said there were four people left, though.
If two of them art thou and myself, that leaveth another two...
But one of them is the Crown Prince, so...
'Tis decided, then. Excuse me, I'll be going soon!

Mokou:
Off to your next opponent then?
Be careful though, this is the Bamboo Forest of the Lost.
Even if you fly into the sky, it's not that easy to get out.

Futo:
Ugh. Mine apologies for earlier. Couldst thou please guide me?

Futo:
I beseech thee! Let us wager our balls and fight!

Byakuren:
Oh my, so you're offering alms?

Byakuren:
To think you'd come here with the balls. That saves me some time.

Futo:
So how about it? Orbs this flawless surely possesseth virtue. As a gift to the temple they'd be...
Wait, of course I'm not giving them to thee!
I'm here to steal the ball that thou possessest.

Byakuren:
Oh, that must be tiresome then. But, from me of all people?
Surely there are others it would be easier to steal from.

Futo:
I'd prefer not to fight thee myself, but I have no choice.
The only other person who hath any is the Crown Prince.

Byakuren:
Ah, so you're saying I'd be easier than her?
So, why do you want to gather the balls anyway?

Futo:
Huh? Because they say that once thou gatherest seven, thine wish will be granted.
Mine heart's desire will...
No, nevermind. I mustn't count my chickens afore they hatch.

Byakuren:
Very well.
Will gathering seven really grant wishes or not?
I'll take your ball and test it out myself.
Of course, I'm absolutely sure that nothing of the sort will occur!

Byakuren:
I wonder what to wish for. Ah, yes, perhaps some nice Buddhist cuisine...

Futo:
Huh? Thou wantest me to hand over the Occult Ball?

Futo:
But surely thou hast already plenty of thine own, Crown Prince?

Miko:
I've confirmed a new fact about the balls.
Accordingly, I'm going to gather every last one of them.
As you know, it's impossible to give them away on your own,
so prepare yourself!

Futo:
Why didst thou lose?

Futo:
So what's the new fact?

Miko:
It seems that there is someone scattering the balls periodically.
But, if there are too many left over before that happens, something bad will occur.

Miko:
I know you're in possession of a ball.
I say this for your sake; just quietly hand it over.

Ichirin:
She's here! The mysterious Red-Blue Mantle!
You sound so unenthusiastic. If you want the balls, then you gotta be more urban legend-like!

Miko:
Oh, you certainly have a point. Would that please the creator of the balls as well?
The red mantle, or the blue mantle! Shout which one you want!

Ichirin:
All right, I want both! Give me both!

Ichirin:
Really, the blue mantle is quite nice...

Miko:
With both the Red Mantle and the Blue Mantle, I'm going to have to cover you with blood and then drain you of blood, but...
Well, for now I'll just take the ball. We'll do this later, when there's more time.

Ichirin:
Eek!

Nitori:
You want me to hand over my balls?

Miko:
Indeed. Unfortunately, it seems we'll have to fight in order to exchange them.

Nitori:
Sure, I'll give you the balls. So.

Miko:
So? What?

Nitori:
You know, I'm asking how much you're paying.

Miko:
Oh, you're talking about money? Very well, I'll pay the asking price.

Nitori:
Pleasure doing business. But it looks like we'll have to fight to exchange them.

Miko:
I know. Then let's get started.

Nitori:
If I wind up winning, I don't make any profit„Éº

Nitori:
Pleasure doing business. Now pay up.

Miko:
What a miser.

Nitori:
It's gonna come back to me soon enough anyway.
I can't believe you actually paid money for it. It's the height of stupidity.

Miko:
Believers of this idolatry wouldn't understand.
The only thing with real value is speed.

Shinmyoumaru:
All right, stop!

Shinmyoumaru:
You there! You've got a lot of balls, right?
I was right to keep an eye out for people who've gathered lots of balls.

Miko:
You... I must have overlooked you because you're so small.

Shinmyoumaru:
Because I'm small? Don't make fun of me!
I may look like this, but I'm a proud member of the inchling race.

Miko:
Oh, so you've inherited the blood of Sukuna-Hikona?
What sort of urban legend would such a person use?

Shinmyoumaru:
I'll make sure you get a taste of that!
As they say, smallness is strength!

Shinmyoumaru:
Woohoo! I got a whole ton! I'm definitely gonna grow bigger now~

Shinmyoumaru:
*sob* I was so close to getting seven, too...
Nothing would happen if you gather the balls, right?

Miko:
What did you intend to do with the balls?

Shinmyoumaru:
Everyone said that if you gather seven you can get bigger.

Miko:
Where could you have heard a rumor like that?
No matter, there's only one remaining. Most likely, that should be all of them.

Miko:
Now, you're the last one. Quietly hand over the ball.

Byakuren:
What are you planning to do, after gathering the balls like this?

Miko:
I've determined the true nature of the balls.
It appears that they have the property of piercing through space once they've been gathered.

Byakuren:
What was that? A spatial transfer trap?

Miko:
Well, I caught on to that part rather quickly.
The problem, though, is the remaining balls.
When more than seven are gathered, the extras split up and fill the land with the occult once more.
In other words, if we don't gather all the balls at once, this ruckus will never end.

Byakuren:
I had a feeling it was something like that. But gathering alone isn't enough. That wouldn't resolve anything, right?
If anything, it would make the ruckus bigger.

Miko:
I thought that too, and planned to proceed cautiously until the end, but recently I realized something else.
The balls' spacetime transfer powers only work in Gensokyo.

Miko:
They have no effect in my dojo. In other words, as long as they're in my possession, they can be researched to our hearts' content.

Byakuren:
That's an interesting theory.
But I simply cannot entrust such a mighty yet unknown power to your sole possession.

Miko:
I thought you'd say that.
We'd have to fight to exchange balls anyway,
so you've just saved me the trouble of inciting your gentle disposition to battle!

Byakuren:
I'll seal them away and prove it. Using the occult to punish the occult is the best option.

Mamizou:
Got a moment?
I've got a little question for ya.

Marisa:
I've got a bad feelin' 'bout this.

Mamizou:
I wanna talk to you about another world.

Marisa:
What?

Mamizou:
You sure you're not hiding something?

Marisa:
How much do you know?

Mamizou:
I'm asking because I don't know.

Marisa:
Welp, not much else to do. Wanna fight?

Marisa:
Hey, hey, I was tryin' to lose on purpose an' all...

Marisa:
Here, That's an Occult Ball.

Mamizou:
Oh? So you are giving me this?

Marisa:
You looking into the stuff about the outside world, right?
So you need to gather these and check it out yourself.

Reimu:
An Occult Ball?
If you want one of those things, I'm sure I have one...

Mamizou:
Then could you lend it to me for a bit?

Reimu:
Sorry, I can't get rid of it on my own.

Mamizou:
What? That sounds like some kind of cursed item.

Reimu:
Cursed... well, it might be, in a sense.

Mamizou:
I just got one from Marisa, though...

Reimu:
You fought her, right?
They leave you if you lose a fight.

Mamizou:
What an interesting rule.
Then let's get this started.

Reimu:
Could these be aliens?

Reimu:
If you want the Occult Ball, you can have it.

Mamizou:
Really? That's not like you at all.

Reimu:
I have some preparations to make before I investigate the balls.

Mamizou:
I see, I see. Then I'll just take it without worrying about it.

Mamizou:
I get it now.
I've figured out what these balls really are.

Mamizou:
Oh, it's you...?

Kokoro:
Hey, am I pretty?

Mamizou:
Well, that came out of nowhere.

Kokoro:
Am I not pretty?

Mamizou:
Ah, I've heard those lines before. The Kuchisake-onna?
Um, what was it again?
Not mousse, not wax...

Kokoro:
I won't let you say it! If I'm not pretty, then die!

Kokoro:
Ohhh, hair-styling products are so scary.

Mamizou:
Oh, I remember now. It was pomade.

Kokoro:
Gah! She got me„Éº

Mamizou:
Oh? You've got an Occult Ball too?
I'll be borrowing that.

Mamizou:
I get it now. These balls I've got my hands on...
...are stones gathered from sacred places in the Outside World.
Those things they call 'Power Stones', y'know?
With these, just about anyone could break the barrier.

Kasen:
...what are you doing? You, of all people.

Mamizou:
So you found me?

Kasen:
I thought I told you to leave this alone if you value your life.
So were you lying when you said you didn't want to be wrapped up in something troublesome?

Mamizou:
Aren't you underestimating me?
Even without these balls, I can go to the Outside World whenever I want.

Kasen:
I won't overlook any further interference. I'll just say you happily went back to the Outside World.

Kasen:
If you just behave yourself for a little while longer, our trap will be complete.

Mamizou:
Ooh, scary. For a second, I thought I was gonna meet my end in a place like this.
Don't worry, though. I can hazard a guess as to what you're planning.

Kasen:
...

Mamizou:
The person behind the Occult Balls is in the Outside World, right?

Kasen:
...!

Mamizou:
As long as she's there, you can't lay a hand on her.
So you're going to properly lure her into Gensokyo, I imagine?

Kasen:
You sure know it pretty well.

Mamizou:
I thought Reimu and Marisa were acting oddly, like they were hiding something.
Are they cooperating with you on this too?

Kasen:
Those two were supposed to be the force to implement the last stage of the plan after we drag the enemy into Gensokyo.

Mamizou:
I see, so that's why they're not too eager to gather the balls?

Kasen:
However, this is a dangerous gamble.
Even if we have a good reason, we'd still be breaking the rules of Gensokyo.

Mamizou:
Then why not let me be the force who handles the Outside World?

Kasen:
Huh?

Mamizou:
If it was ever found out that you interfered outside, it would raise some false suspicions.
For me, though, I'd be fine no matter what happened.
And I'm the one who knows the most about the Outside World anyway.
I'm going use this ball and set a little trap of my own.

Mamizou:
I didn't really notice it back when I lived in the Outside World...
But, now that I look at it again, the changes are bewildering.
Is it thriving, or declining?
Well, either way, to experience change is to be alive.

Sumireko:
Ooh, I caught another one~

Sumireko:
That tail... This time it's an easy-to-identify youkai„Éº

Mamizou:
My, a human flying in the sky is pretty rare these days.
I see, I see, so it's you.
I'm surprised it was a female student, though.

Sumireko:
You're calling us 'female students' in this day and age? Man, you're old fashioned.

Mamizou:
But I'm glad. Thanks to you, Gensokyo's gotten pretty exciting lately.

Sumireko:
Right? I knew it.
If it caused a big ripple, it was worth throwing the stone, after all.

Mamizou:
By the way, do you have some kind of ultimate goal for this?

Sumireko:
Not really? I found something that looked fun, so I tried it out.
I'm not thinking of anything bothersome like an "ultimate goal".

Mamizou:
Is that so? Well, that sounds about right for a modern female stu- I mean, teenage schoolgirl.
But you'll get bored of that pretty soon.
So, how about a match with me?

Sumireko:
A match?

Mamizou:
I've got a new Power Stone right here.

Sumireko:
Wha- could that be...?

Mamizou:
That's right, I caught on.
The Occult Balls are really stones taken from Power Spots.
And what I'm holding is Gensokyo's very own Power Stone.
With just this, you could come and go to Gensokyo whenever you want.

Mamizou:
If you can beat me, I'll give it to you.

Sumireko:
Interesting~. I want it, I want it.
So, what happens if I lose?

Mamizou:
Let's see...
How about you give me a tour of the Outside World for a day?

Sumireko:
Is that all? Then I'm in~

Mamizou:
Of course, I'm obviously gonna be the one to win. Don't try too hard, now.

Sumireko:
All right„Éº I'm getting fired up now.
Time to show off my ESP!

Sumireko:
All right„Éº Now I can visit Gensokyo as much as I want!

Mokou:
Oh, did something happen? I haven't seen you in a while.

Reimu:
How are you doing?

Mokou:
Unfortunately, my body's pretty frail. Just moving causes damage to it.

Reimu:
Is that so? But I finally found you.
I never thought you'd be holding a ball.

Mokou:
You're here about the balls too?
Well, whatever. If you want it, try and take it.

Reimu:
Even though you're an immortal, you've gone frail and weak? That's quite absurd, you know.

Mokou:
And I get another boring ball.
Hmm? This ball is...
It's got an aura I've never tasted before.

Reimu:
I think that one was the Yomihirasaka ball.

Marisa:
Oh, I don't see you around very often. What is it, a lost child?

Mokou:
Do you have an Occult Ball?

Marisa:
Ooh? You want the balls?

Mokou:
It's because I finally figured out why everyone wants these balls.

Marisa:
The balls won't come out unless we fight. You know that, right?

Mokou:
Of course. Hurry up and die.

Marisa:
It didn't look like it but this one was using an urban legend.

Marisa:
You didn't need to fight seriously you know...

Mokou:
I've never needed to hold back since the day I was born. That's how I live.

Marisa:
Fine, the ball's yours.

Mokou:
Hmm, this one's not it.

Marisa:
Huh? What's with that?

Mokou:
I guess not all of them are connected the world beyond.

Nitori:
What's that? You want the balls?

Mokou:
Yeah. I heard you've been selling them.

Nitori:
All right, sure thing.
How much are you looking to pay?

Mokou:
Let's see... give me your cheapest.

Nitori:
Stop joking around, these are extremely valuable.

Mokou:
Come to think of it, kappa suffer when they run out of water, right?
How about I help you get rid of the balls yourself by drying you out?

Nitori:
Uwah, what a rude customer. Gotta throw some salt!

Nitori:
Ow ow ow.
You're troubling me, customer. No need to be so violent.

Mokou:
This one's a dud too, huh?
Was it just a coincidence that Reimu came around the Yomihirasaka ball?

Nitori:
Just a round ball?

Mokou:
Just a round ball.

Mokou:
Maybe I misunderstood something.
There are a lot less balls from the world beyond than I thought.
Everyone's in such a frenzy to get ahold of them,
that I was sure gathering them all would let you die...

Mokou:
Who are you?

Kasen:
I should be asking you the same.

Mokou:
Oh... I've seen you before.
The mountain hermit, right? I'm a human living in the bamboo forest.

Kasen:
A human?
You managed to gather seven balls so easily though.

Mokou:
So what happens when they're gathered?

Kasen:
Since you've ended up with them, I suppose I have no choice but to tell you.
Whoever gathers them is sent flying to the Outside World.
That's where the enemy is, and because of her location we can't attack her, That's our current situation...

Mokou:
The Outside World, huh?
I see... It's been a while, so it might be interesting.

Kasen:
A human like you would be only be endangered by going to the Outside World.
There's not much time left.
Don't worry, I'll fall into the trap in your place!

Kasen:
If we don't pull that person to Gensokyou somehow, then...

Kasen:
I was wondering how you managed to gather the balls so easily.
You're strong, for a human.

Mokou:
It's 'cause I've lived too long.

Kasen:
Well, in that case you should be fine in the Outside World.

Mokou:
It's been a long time since I've seen Shaba. It makes me feel the will to live again. Just a bit.

Kasen:
Your time there will be limited, but still, try not to go too wild.

Mokou:
Whoa...
This isn't the world I knew. So this is the Outside World?
Well, I guess I should've expected it. It's been nearly a thousand years since then.

Sumireko:
I just keep catching them one after another. What a haul.

Mokou:
Oops, I've been caught by an Outside human.
Should I erase her?

Sumireko:
Ooh, scary.
I keep getting all these belligerent people.
It's too terrible to be a joke.

Mokou:
She told me not to go wild out here,
but seeing someone so soaked in complacency just pisses me off.

Sumireko:
Complacency? How rude.
I live the stifling life of a high school student in our problematic modern society.
You've never lived my life, what do you know?

Mokou:
She seems strong enough. It should be okay to play with her a little, right?

Sumireko:
As I thought, everyone in Gensokyo just wants to fight.
And they all look down on their opponents too. So which is gonna win:
The wisdom of humanity, or a devil born of distortion?
I won't be satisfied until I've tested this!

Sumireko:
You're an immortal? Could you perhaps be one of those three-eyed people?

Shinmyoumaru:
All right! Hey, you giant over there!

Ichirin:
G-Giant? Oh, you mean Unzan?

Shinmyoumaru:
I'm here to take all your Occult Balls!

Ichirin:
If we're betting our balls on a battle, I'm not gonna lose!

Shinmyoumaru:
Now, prepare yourself! Giantess!

Ichirin:
Gah, Giantess?

Ichirin:
A giantess, you meant the Hasshaku-sama? I'm shocked.

Shinmyoumaru:
I got the balls!
Ooh... You had quite a lot of them.

Ichirin:
And I was on a winning streak too...

Shinmyoumaru:
All right! Hand over the balls, you rotting hermit!

Futo:
Rotting... thou sayest?

Shinmyoumaru:
You're a shikaisen. That's pretty much the same as rotting.

Futo:
I can be a hermit because I take care not to rot.

Shinmyoumaru:
Who cares? Just fight me already and hand over the balls!

Futo:
Mind yourself, lest I trample over the wee piddling.

Shinmyoumaru:
Yay, fate is on my side today. Just one more and I'll have all seven.

Futo:
I'll give thee the balls, but I'm not rotting, right?

Shinmyoumaru:
Yeah, yeah.
I was just provoking you. If you weren't angry, I wouldn't be able to take the ball.

Futo:
I see. That's fine then.

Shinmyoumaru:
See ya later, you zombie priest!

Shinmyoumaru:
*ba-dump* *ba-dump*
I've never been to the Underworld before. I'm so nervous.
For some reason, I couldn't find anyone else with ball on the surface.

Koishi:
Hello~!

Shinmyoumaru:
Maybe someone's going to swipe them from me.

Koishi:
Hello~! I'm right behind you.

Shinmyoumaru:
Hm? Did I just hear something?

Koishi:
Hello~! I'm behind you!

Shinmyoumaru:
Wait, could it be!?
The Occult Ball's screams are reverberating through my soul!

Koishi:
The No.1 for smooth connection!

Shinmyoumaru:
That surprised me„Éº
I thought an Occult Ball swooped down and attacked me.

Koishi:
So my presence is weaker than the Occult Ball's?

Shinmyoumaru:
It's not so much weak as... You don't make much of an impression?
Anyway, with this I've gotten seven. I can finally get bigger„Éº

Shinmyoumaru:
Now then, it's the long-awaited ritual time.
Look! Marvel at this overwhelming Occult Power!
I know my body's being filled with the power of fantasy.
Now, make my body Bigger„Éº!
Eek, that was such an embarrassing monologue.

Mamizou:
I saw that.

Shinmyoumaru:
What„Éº?
Now that you've seen me, I can't let you live.
Die.

Mamizou:
Now there, why so hasty? Everbody makes one or two embarassing remarks in a while.

Mamizou:
I see, so an inchling like you ended up getting seven balls.

Shinmyoumaru:
Once you get seven, you can get bigger, right?
Who who else other than me could get any use out of them?

Mamizou:
Hmm, I hate to tell you this, but even if you gather them, you won't get any bigger.

Shinmyoumaru:
Huh?

Mamizou:
I think it's pretty crazy to believe a rumor like that though.

Shinmyoumaru:
In that case, what are these balls for then?

Mamizou:
Well, since you've taken my share of them too,
You'll have to test that out for yourself.

Shinmyoumaru:
Whoa...
What's up with this shining night?
Wait, could this be the legendary Land of Science, Laputa?

Sumireko:
Wow„Éº
You're„Éºadorable„Éº! Are you riding in a bowl?

Sumireko:
You're like Issun-Boshi! Well, you're a bit bigger than 1 sun(Ôºä). ÔºàÔºäAbout 3 CentimetersÔºâ

Shinmyoumaru:
Umm... Are you a scientist?
What are you planning to do with me?

Sumireko:
Maybe I'll make you into a pet?
To think there were humans this small. It's awesome„Éº
It's like a modern day circus attraction„Éº!

Shinmyoumaru:
Eek!
Laputa does human experimentation? Oh, the humanity.
Like I'd let myself get caught in a place like this, before I can get bigger„Éº!

Sumireko:
What should I feed her though? Maybe she likes cat food.

Nitori:
Balls for sale„Éº

Marisa:
So you're selling Occult Balls?

Nitori:
Yeah, that's right. They're going for cheap.

Marisa:
Are you buying them too?

Nitori:
Sure, that's okay too. Of course, that's also cheap.

Marisa:
Woah there, I actually didn't wanna buy 'em.

Nitori:
Well, here's the money for the sale.

Marisa:
I never thought of turning them into money. Since I don't need 'em, that's perfect.
Wait, that's cheap!

Ichirin:
You showed up at a good time. Let's wager our balls on a match!

Nitori:
How uncivilized. These balls are valuable merchandise.
I don't suppose you were planning to pay for them?

Ichirin:
So what! We've got a good reason to fight so why not enjoy ourselves?

Ichirin:
Looks like I got ahold of a Shirikodama, too.

Nitori:
In that case, I'll be taking the ball. And you don't need money, right?

Ichirin:
Hey. Isn't your urban legend artificial?

Nitori:
Yeah. What about it?

Ichirin:
I was just thinking, Doesn't that mean you're not carrying an Occult Ball?

Nitori:
No, I have them.

Ichirin:
So the Occult Balls even have and effect on artificial urban legends? I'll have to rethink this.

Nitori:
But isn't your urban legend something people made up too?

Ichirin:
I guess so, now that you mention it.

Nitori:
Balls for sale„Éº

Mokou:
If you're looking for the master of this house, she's not in.

Nitori:
Oh? You're an unfamiliar face, but...

Mokou:
I was guiding someone, and I just thought I'd drop by on the way.
Since I heard that there were immortals living here.

Nitori:
I see. Well, if they're not here, then they're not here.
She's the only customer I've had who actually bought the Occult Balls.

Mokou:
Are you a kappa? Kappa like to play with balls too, right?
I mean, they gather shirikodama too.

Nitori:
Changing the subject, do you need a ball?

Mokou:
Nope.
Well, I didn't earlier, but maybe now I want one.

Nitori:
Oh? Then by all means.

Mokou:
We can't exchange them without fighting, right? Then let's just cut to the chase!

Mokou:
This ball's a dud. The Yomihirasaka ball should be around somewhere, though.

Nitori:
Huh? You already had a ball?
It didn't look like you were using an urban legend though, unlike everyone else around here.

Mokou:
Ah, I don't know much about that urban legend stuff.
Everyone else was certainly being attached with some kind of weird ghost though. I shouldn't have anything like that.
You've got some artificial monster, right? Can you get balls with that too?

Nitori:
Hmm.
I've been going around selling them until now, but maybe I need to take a careful look at these balls one more time.

Mamizou:
Now then, all that's left is to wait.

Mamizou:
Hm? Who's there?

Nitori:
What's this? What are you doing?

Mamizou:
A kappa? ...well, fine. Better than a loudmouth tengu, at least.
It has nothing to do with you so just keep quiet and go home.
Go home, sleep, and forget all about this.

Nitori:
Ah, yeah, I really don't want to get caught up in anything troublesome.
I'll just pretend I never saw this.

Mamizou:
Hm? You've got someone interesting with you.

Nitori:
Someone interesting? Oh, you mean Nessie here?
This is my proud creation, a USO machine. It's not for sale.

Mamizou:
No, that's not it. What, you never noticed?
It's behind you. You're being haunted by something huge.

Nitori:
What? St-Stop joking around.

Mamizou:
You think this is a joke? You're in danger, if you don't notice it.

Nitori:
A-threat like that won't work on me. There's nothing there.

Mamizou:
*sigh* How foolish.

Mamizou:
Very well then. Let's drag out that tall tale you've got haunting you.

Mamizou:
Now then. Let's continue, shall we?

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Right now, I'm standing right behind you!

Reimu:
I'd heard that the urban legends have even spread to the Underworld, but...

Koishi:
I'm right behind you!

Reimu:
Uh... What?
You keep that saying you're behind me, but I can see you right in front of me.

Koishi:
I'm telling you to get scared!

Reimu:
You were standing behind me so suddenly. How terrifying.

Koishi:
Don't you know her? Miss Mary?

Reimu:
Not really. I'm not too familiar with her.

Koishi:
Behind you...

Koishi:
Miss Mary's not very famous, huh?
I thought she'd be a bit more famous.
Hey, you over there! How about you?

Marisa:
Ack! Someone's here!
Don't just pop out like that! You sure surprised me.

Koishi:
I've been here since the start. Behind you, that is!

Marisa:
I do know of Miss Mary's phone call, though.

Koishi:
Behind you...

Marisa:
I get it, so basically what you want to say is that Miss Mary's not very popular so no one's getting scared.

Koishi:
...Yeah.

Marisa:
You've got it all wrong.
It's just 'cause no one here really knows what a phone is.

Koishi:
Oh! So that was it?

Koishi:
I see, so people not knowing about phones was a blind spot.
I gotta think of another urban legend.

Kasen:
Hm? Who's been watching me for a while now?

Koishi:
It's me! I'm watching you!

Kasen:
Must be my imagination.

Koishi:
That's right! It's your imagination!

Kasen:
That's obviously impossible!
A youkai of the unconscious; What a fearsome fellow.
Since she may appear right next to you without you noticing.
This is a critical moment, so don't get in my way!

Koishi:
By the way, are you familiar with phones?

Kasen:
Yes? Well, I've only heard of them.

Koishi:
Thank goodness!
Then, that means you may get frightened!

Koishi:
Starting now, I'm headed behind you!

Kasen:
Now that the hindrances have been cleared up, let's get down to business.

Kasen:
Even though you play dumb, you're ridiculously strong...

Koishi:
Yay! Yay! Did I scare you?

Kasen:
Yeah, yeah. You sure scared me.

Koishi:
Yaaaay! I didn't need to abandon Miss Mary, either!

Kasen:
Damn, why did it have to be now...?

Koishi:
Hm? Is something happening?

Sumireko:
This is... The shrine?
All right!
It's just like the tanuki said. Looks like I got into Gensokyo properly this time.

Sumireko:
Confirming this was more than enough for today! I'll head back home and make preparations at once!

Koishi:
Hello, hello!

Sumireko:
Hm? Did I just hear something?

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Can you hear me?

Sumireko:
...Could it be coming from my smartphone?
This place is outside the service area. ...I must be imagining things.
There's no way my cell would get reception here...

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Hey, answer the phone.

Sumireko:
Now that I think about it, wasn't there a ghost story like that?
Getting a call on your phone even though you're outside the service range.
And then someone says something like: "Right now, I'm right behind you."

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Now, I'm
Right in front of you!

Sumireko:
Uwaaah! I-It's hereee! It's a ghost!

Sumireko:
Quickly! I have to escape to the Outside World (peaceful world) !

Kokoro:
Hey... Am I pretty?

Ichirin:
Whoa, that surprised me!
Oh, it's just the Kuchisake-onna.

Ichirin:
Okay, pomade, pomade.

Kokoro:
Heh heh heh. Having overcome hair products, I am the true Kuchisake-onna!
That incantation hast no effect!

Ichirin:
What the hell was that?

Ichirin:
No way, impossible... The incantation from the legend, Pomade, has no effect?!

Kokoro:
Ha ha ha. The Kuchisake-onna will never stop powering up!
Now, go spread those rumors! Make me even stronger!

Nitori:
Damn, it sure got late.

Nitori:
I'm self-employed too, so I don't get paid for overtime. Dammit!

Kokoro:
Hey, hey. Miss Kappa over there,
Am I pretty?

Nitori:
Pomade!

Kokoro:
Ha ha ha! Did you think your hair products would work on the Kuchisake-onna forever!?

Nitori:
ÔºÅ?

Kokoro:
Take this!

Nitori:
Now then, time to go home and get some sleep.

Nitori:
So, pomade doesn't work?

Kokoro:
Even the Kuchisake-onna will keep maturing.

Nitori:
But like, you're not the Kuchisake-onna, are you?

Kokoro:
Huh?

Nitori:
You're a mask monster.

Kokoro:
That's true. Huh? My mask is damaged...

Kokoro:
Excuse mee!
I was thinking I'd like to have my mask repaired.

Futo:
If you're looking for the Crown Prince, she's away at the moment.

Futo:
She appeared to have some important task at the shrine...
Wait, how come you still possess balls?
I thought the Crown Prince had collected them all...

Kokoro:
Balls?

Futo:
There might have been some changes in her plans.
No matter, I shall simply take your balls and head to meet with her.

Futo:
So the balls have returned once more...

Kokoro:
Oh yeah! Am I pretty?

Futo:
That's not something to be asking someone who you just beat up.

Kokoro:
I had forgotten the Kuchisake-onna's duty.
Now, I gotta go ask her to fix my mask!

Miko:
Who is it?
Oh, the Menreiki...? What is it? Don't bother me right now.

Kokoro:
What are you doing?

Miko:
Something that does not concern you.

Kokoro:
If you're not busy, could you fix my mask for me?

Miko:
I'm telling you that I am busy.

Miko:
This is a critical moment for the strife that these balls lay at the heart of...
...Wait, why do you still have Occult Balls?
That was close. I had intended to gather all of them,
but I didn't think I'd still find more at this time.

Miko:
How odd... There are way too many Occult Balls. What does this mean?

Sumireko:
... All right.
I've reached Gensokyo safely once again„Éº
Until now, I've only been able to get in temporarily...
But as long as I have Gensokyo's Power Stone that I got from the bakedanuki, I can come in freely.

???:
Welcome to Gensokyo.

Sumireko:
Oh, you're that person from before.

Kasen:
I'm here to properly invite you into Gensokyo.

Sumireko:
Wait, could it be that the Power Stone I got from the tanuki is really...?

Kasen:
It's a bit late to realize that now. It was transformed by a tanuki.

Sumireko:
Crap, it was a trap?

Kasen:
There's no longer any way for you to get home.
Just accept Gensokyo's baptism for as long as you like!

Kasen:
Uh-oh. It'd be troublesome, if you died here.

Sumireko:
What have I done? Can I really not get home?

Kasen:
Feel free to run from place to place.
If there's anywhere in Gensokyo where you can live in peace, that is!

Sumireko:
Ugh.

Kasen:
...well, that should be threatening enough for now.
If we screw up and she ends up dying, there might be some kind of investigation from the outside world, after all.
Well, enjoy your terrifying night in Gensokyo.

Sumireko:
Where am I?
It looks an old village straight out of a movie set.

Ichirin:
Po-po-po-po-po...

Sumireko:
Ah, a woman...

Ichirin:
Who is it? Why, it's a human I've never seen before.
Good! Be filled with terror.

Sumireko:
*heartbeat* What kind of youkai is she...?

Ichirin:
Po-po-po-po-po...

Sumireko:
That laughter... could it be Hasshaku-sama!?
A made-up urban legend from the Internet age has come to life„Éº!?

Ichirin:
The Internet age? What do you mean?

Sumireko:
If it's the real Hasshaku-sama, then I've gotta run. If she catches me, I'm dead.

Ichirin:
So who was that? I've never seen her before.

Kokoro:
Hey, Miss Human. Do you have a moment?
Am I pretty?

???:
Whew, I'm saved„Éº

Sumireko:
I'm being chased by Hasshaku-sama. Please save me.
...wait, you've got that general 'youkai' look too.

Kokoro:
Oh, that's right! Since I'm going to kill you anyway, I was going to stop asking the question.
Not pretty? Then die!

Sumireko:
Whaaat?
I may not be that confident about my looks, but I'm not that ugly„Éº

Kokoro:
By the way, who are you?

Sumireko:
*pant pant* It's the real Kuchisake-onna!
A really legendary urban legend.
It seems like humans live here, but this town is dangerous„Éº

Kokoro:
Yay! The Kuchisake-onna finally scared someone.

Sumireko:
But...
Other than that village, it doesn't look like there's anywhere else people are living.
Ah, I wanna get back home to the Outside World however I can.

Marisa:
Oh, I finally found you.

Sumireko:
Aah! You're that human from back then!

Marisa:
The name's Marisa Kirisame.

Sumireko:
I'm saved„Éº I've been trapped in Gensokyo (this world) and the roads are getting dark.

Marisa:
Hehehehehe.

Sumireko:
What's so funny? You're a human, so help me„Éº

Marisa:
Who said I was gonna help you? Just 'cause we're both humans don't mean we're on the same side.
I've been looking for you, to give you a good beatin'.
Have a taste of Gensokyo's baptism!

Marisa:
I wonder if I went too far?

Sumireko:
Eek! Why'd you attack me„Éº?

Marisa:
Why? Shouldn't you know?
You're the one who started this whole ruckus.

Sumireko:
Oh, come on. It was just a little prank„Éº
I don't deserve this cruel imprisonment„Éº

Marisa:
She's still not sorry, is she?
Guess we'd better keep givin' her a hard time.

Sumireko:
The surface is completely covered with youkai.
I'm so sorry for saying I wasn't scared of youkai.
Youkai are really scary after all...

Shinmyoumaru:
Aah, who is it?

Sumireko:
Ah, it's you.

Shinmyoumaru:
Hey„Éº, you're that pervert from earlier! What are you doing at my castle!?

Sumireko:
Ack„Éº You're just so cute„Éº! I'm being restored„Éº

Shinmyoumaru:
Crap„Éº, you chased me all the way up here„Éº?

Shinmyoumaru:
My home's been found, I have no choice but to kill you.

Sumireko:
If something so cute lives here, I can't give up on Gensokyo after all.
...Wait, this is silly. I don't have time for this„Éº
I have to find a way to get home.

Sumireko:
Hmm? Looks like I'm lost.

Mokou:
Oh, if it isn't that Outside human from back then!

Sumireko:
Yeah, it's been a while„Éº! Thank goodness, I ran into someone I know„Éº

Mokou:
So you want to continue our duel, then?

Sumireko:
Ah, no, now's not a good time-

Mokou:
I bet you won't be on this side for too much longer.
Let's get this started already!

Mokou:
Is that all? Maybe this fantasy world isn't for you after all.

Sumireko:
Phew„Éº, I'm sick of fighting already.
I just wanna go home, but I don't know how.

Mokou:
Ah? Well, yeah, of course.

Sumireko:
Huh?

Mokou:
This Bamboo Forest of the Lost has a curse on it, making it so anyone would get lost here.
I'll guide you out, so where are you headed?

Sumireko:
So, in the end, I'm just back at the shrine...
Whenever I come to Gensokyo, I always end up here, huh?
I have to come up with a way to get home...

???:
You're late.

Miko:
I've been waiting for you.

Sumireko:
So what is it this time? Just let me go home already...

Miko:
You wish to go home?
How interesting.
I've been waiting here to send you back to the Outside World.
Along with these Occult Balls.

Sumireko:
Huh, the Occult Balls!?
Oh, yeah! If I had those, I should be able to go home, if only temporarily.
Why didn't I think of that sooner?

Miko:
I've seen through the trick behind these balls.

Miko:
I thought you were using them to sneak into Gensokyo, but I was wrong.
You've come to Gensokyo many times to scatter the balls, correct?
Although during those times, only your came only with your shadow, so not many people could see you.
This time, let's send you home with all the Occult Balls.

Miko:
Hey, hey, you shouldn't have lost here.

Mamizou:
What is it?

Mamizou:
If you're looking for that human, she'll be back soon.
She still hasn't left Gensokyo properly, after all.

Reimu:
I don't have any time for that!
Take me to the Outside World!

Mamizou:
What ever is the matter with you? Cool down a bit, young missy.

Mamizou:
Didn't we promise you'd be last? No need to rush.
The plan was for everyone to teach her a lesson. You're going to be the best part of that.

Reimu:
There's no time to take this slowly: I realized something serious.
As she is now, she's still got one more trick up her sleeve!
The balls have one last secret hidden in them.

Reimu:
All right„Éº, now I can go after her.

Mokou:
Oh, looks like something fun is starting up again.

Mokou:
If you're going to the Outside World, then take me with you.

Reimu:
Don't be ridiculous. I already said I was in a hurry and all.

Mokou:
I guided a human from outside over here earlier.
She dropped something. I'm here to return it.

Reimu:
Save that kind of stupid errand for later!
Gensokyo's currently facing its biggest crisis.

Mokou:
Is this passage made just for one?

Reimu:
I'm going to go see her right now, so just give it to me and I'll take care of it.
Why'd you guide her here, anyway?

Mokou:
Because she wanted to go home.
I figured it would be best to take her to the shrine.

Reimu:
*sigh* You're pretty nice, huh?

Kasen:
Huh? Why are you here, Reimu?
She should be returning to Gensokyo soon.

Reimu:
The situation's changed; I don't have time to wait.
Let me meet her right now.

Kasen:
No. It may be only temporary, but you've left Gensokyo through the proper procedures. 
If you fight the human in that condition, there's no way you won't stand out.

Reimu:
I don't have time for your explanations! If I don't take her back to Gensokyo right now, we're all in trouble.

Kasen:
Crap, I've gotten too overzealous.

Kasen:
So what's going on? Explain.

Reimu:
There's an odd one out mixed in among the Occult Balls.

Kasen:
Those are the Outside World's Power Stones, right?

Reimu:
But the Lunar Capital ball is the only one that's not from the Outside World!
Maybe she was being used by someone else, I don't know.
I think she probably hasn't realized it herself...
But if that ball's true power is used in its current condition, it'll connect to somewhere other than Gensokyo as well!

Reimu:
I found you.

Sumireko:
Y-You've chased me all the way out here!?
C'mon, just forgive me already.

Reimu:
This farce is over.
I'm taking you into protective custody.

Sumireko:
So you're blaming me for everything again„Éº?

Reimu:
No, I'm not, that's why it's "protective"...

Sumireko:
I get it, I get it, it's fine.
As president of the Secret Sealing Club, those who divulge secrets, this is my one last big job.
I don't know how things will turn out, and I was prepared to get done in by some stranger from Gensokyo anyway, but...

Sumireko:
I have no choice but to unleash the power of the Occult Balls.
Once I release them, I will personally become a key to destroy Gensokyo's barrier!

Reimu:
No, wait- Stop, it's a trap!

Sumireko:
The death of this high school girl you cornered will surely remain in your memory!
Ah, what a beautiful death. What a worthwhile death.

Reimu:
It's not beautiful at all! There's nothing worthwhile about a suicide bombing!
I am the shrine maiden of paradise, Reimu Hakurei!
I'll protect the Barrier, no matter what!
And I'm not gonna let some human die stupidly right in front of me!

Sumireko:
My final night in the Human World will be...

Reimu:
Your first night in Gensokyo will be...

Sumireko  Reimu:
Etched into the depths of your genes!
Etched until you're sick of the nightmares!

Reisen:
...These wavelengths are no good.
Tonight's moon is emitting even more light of insanity.
I've got a bad feeling about this, so I ought to finish patrolling quick and get to bed.

Reimu:
So it was you after all!
I heard that there was this gross, insanity-causing urban legend in the bamboo forest.

Reisen:
Gah. My bad feeling was right on the mark.

Reimu:
If it's insanity we're talking about, it's gotta be you.

Reisen:
Yes, yes. I am indeed the source of the kune-kune rumor.
But what about that?

Reimu:
Could you cut that out?

Reimu:
We learned that the Occult Balls were the work of a human outside, and those are gone now...
But the urban legends actually seem to be sinking in deeper.
So I've decided to keep watch and make sure that nobody misuses the urban legends.

Reisen:
Oh.
That's quite a bold claim to make, considering everyone's up to their neck in the things already.

Reimu:
Well, nobody's misusing them, so it's fine by me.

Reisen:
...Do you know the cause of this incident?

Reimu:
Mm... In the end, I'm not really sure. I did hear that it was interference from the Lunar Capital, but...
Wait, you guys are from the Lunar Capital. You've got something to do with it after all, don't you?

Reisen:
You say you're keeping watch to make sure nobody misuses them, but you're working off of information that vague?
From where I'm standing, it looks more like you're being taken advantage of to spread the incident further!
Now, just behave yourself and hand your urban legend over!

Reimu:
-

Reimu:
Ow, ow, ow.

Reisen:
You came at me pretty seriously, there.
Did you mean what you said about 'preventing misuse', too?

Reimu:
...Well, to be honest, that part wasn't true.
I'm just getting more and more annoyed that I can't ignore the things.
But I thought maybe there was someone behind them, or something...
Well, you don't seem to be misusing yours, so I'll let it slide just this once.

Reisen:
...The urban legend incident was caused by some trouble within the Lunar Capital.
This problem is out of your hands by now.
Of course, it's already out of mine too...

Reisen:
The kune-kune... is just a manifestation of a rumor someone started about me personally.
Someone probably saw just my ears, and got them confused with that insanity-causing urban legend.
If even sourceless rumors like that can manifest, her power really is something dreadful...
Hm? A visitor?

Reisen:
Oh, you're that lady from the Myouren Temple...

Byakuren:
My apologies for arriving late at night.

Reisen:
What business do you have with us at this hour?

Byakuren:
The Occult Ball panic is over, but the urban legends still haven't settled down, right?

Reisen:
Ahh.

Byakuren:
So I decided to investigate on my own...
And having done so, I found several points of interest.
One: the urban legends can easily be controlled.
Two: when being artificially controlled by someone, that someone can only wield a rumor that matches their temperament.
Three: a subset of urban legends that fulfill some kind of condition, such as not having any tangible details, do not manifest.
Four: their influence is strongest during the full moon.
...That's what I've found out.
That last point, about the full moon, is what seems especially peculiar to me...
The residents of Eientei are People of the Moon, right? I thought I'd hear what you had to say.

Reisen:
Hm, hm, I see. Thank you for the lengthy explanation.
However, there is no further comment that we at Eientei may offer on the matter.
If I may be frank with you...
Not even we can do all that much about the situation.

Byakuren:
My, my. You came forth with that quite easily.

Byakuren:
So you're essentially admitting that the urban legend incident was caused by the People of the Moon, then!

Reisen:
Well, we would appreciate it if you were to think of it like that.

Byakuren:
All right. I understand now. My apologies, then.

Byakuren:
---Not! There's no way I'd just leave that easily, right?

Byakuren:
That's just all the more reason for me to inquire further!
Now, call your superiors over.

Reisen:
I cannot do that. I've been instructed to drive out any visitors, you see.

Byakuren:
Then you leave me no choice.
Tonight, you're going to regret having been made into a gatekeeper!

Byakuren:
-

Byakuren:
Whew. You're quite determined.
It seems you really are intent on not letting me pass.

Reisen:
Yes. We have nothing to say about the urban legends at this time, so I've been told to let no-one pass.
But, since you came all the way here by yourself, I'll tell you just a little bit more.
The urban legend incident was not caused by anybody from Eientei. And furthermore...
The incident has already been defanged, so there is no longer anything to worry about.

Byakuren:
...I see now. Your determination is certainly the real thing.
The urban legends began to manifest for some reason or another...
And there was some intent behind this at first, but that intent is now gone, so the situation is safe.
That's how I'll choose to interpret this.

Reisen:
Much appreciated. The incident is sure to settle down in the near future, as well.

Byakuren:
Well if that's the case, I'd better enjoy my urban legend while I still can!
All right! Time to take the ol' girl out for a spin tonight!

Reisen:
...And off she goes. Well, drive safely out there.

Reisen:
Whew, I'm beat.
It's hardly a surprise for Miss Reimu to come around here, but the Myouren Temple's chief priest too?
Looks like my master's prediction was right.
Lady Kaguya's endless corridor spell sure came in handy fast, huh...

???:
You over there! Rabbit!

Reisen:
Huh?!

Miko:
Just what is the matter with this corridor?

Miko:
No matter how far I go, there's no end in sight.

Reisen:
Hey, hey, hold on. Just when did you sneak in here?

Miko:
Well, I'm here to speak with the People of the Moon.
Ah, I see... a corridor that continues endlessly?
Made with a power that infinitely links miniscule gaps in space-time together. The power of the Moon's residents, to be sure.

Reisen:
You Taoists really do just sustain yourselves alone and pay no attention to other people's concerns, don't you.

Miko:
...So I ought to use a type of hermit art that absorbs space, then.

Miko:
If left up to me, breaking through this endless-corridor spell is hardly anything difficult.
You! The rabbit over there! I'm about to break down this infinite trap; you don't mind, do you?

Reisen:
Uh, YES! Clearly I mind!
I've been standing here for a while now, but what do you think you're doing barging in here?

Miko:
Oh, goodness, my apologies.
My investigation of the occult incident led me here, you see.
I'd like to know about the Lunar Capital's Occult Ball.
That one certainly is strange...
Occult power is flowing out of it just like a white hole.
Infinitely, to be sure.

Miko:
So I decided to come investigate here... since I've heard that Eientei houses some People of the Moon.

Reisen:
I see.
However, we have nothing to say on this matter.
I cannot let you meet my master, either.

Miko:
Hoho. You admit, then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
That the Moon's people are the source of this occult uproar.

Reisen:
There is nothing we can tell you.

Miko:
I'll just have to investigate by myself, then!

Miko:
-

Miko:
Mmm.
It seems you really don't intend on letting me pass.

Reisen:
Yes. I have my orders, after all.

Miko:
I, too, would rather not kill anyone just for the sake of investigating.
It seems I can't attack any more forcefully than this.

Reisen:
Whew. I take that to mean I got you to reconsider?

Miko:
However... Do you really have nothing at all to tell me?

Reisen:
Well, it goes without saying that the urban legend incident was caused by People of the Moon.

Miko:
Well, yes, you essentially said as much.

Reisen:
Please don't misunderstand, though. Eientei's stance on the matter is ultimately neutral.
We were also the ones who defanged the incident and changed it into something safe.
So please be at ease and have yourself a nice, fun urban legend incident.

Miko:
......
I see. Judging by the resolve you've shown, I'm inclined to believe you.
As thanks for telling me this, I too shall give you a new piece of information.

Miko:
This is something that's very likely to bring about far greater harm than the Occult Ball incident...

Reisen:
Hmmm.
That Taoist's story sure was mysterious.
"An incident is starting to occur where people's minds are taken over or they lose control of their body, or so on."
"It seems that those utilizing urban legends are affected the most strongly."
That's the first I've ever heard of this...
There's nothing like that in either Lady Sagume or Master's plans, too.
I guess that must mean there's somebody misusing the urban legend incident to cause this, then?
And "evidence of this can be seen at the shrine"...

Reimu:
Huh? Did I drop something out here?

Reisen:
Well, no, I don't think you did. But...
Have you noticed anything strange lately?

Reimu:
No... not in particular...?

Reisen:
By the way, what are you doing outside this late?

Reimu:
Huh... Yeah, why am I out here?
I was definitely in bed just a while ago...
I was rolling around thinking, "ugh, it's so hot again tonight, I can't sleep," and before I knew it I was standing outside.

Reisen:
(Her body was taken over...?!)

Reimu:
Uuugh... It's happening again.

Reimu:
My body's not listening to me all of a sudden...!

Reisen:
A-Are you all right!?

Reisen:
Don't tell me this is gonna be some clich√© like "her Gap Woman legend is taking over her body"...!

Mokou:
Woah. Where am I?

Reisen:
Huh?

Mokou:
What the‚Ä¶‚Ä¶? This the shrine?

Reisen:
You're-- you're Mokou!

Mokou:
Aw, if it isn't little Reisen. What's up?

Reisen:
I'm the one who'd like an explanation as to what's up.
I was talking to Miss Reimu until just a second ago.

Mokou:
Reimu? But she's not here.

Reisen:
She was, until a second ago! Right in front of me! Right where you're standing now!

Mokou:
Hmm. Yeah, I got nothin'.
I was out meditating.
When I close my eyes an' meditate, I can see the afterlife much closer!
I was on a roll tonight, too. I could see myself journeying toward the afterlife real clearly...
But as soon as I passed across the river, I found myself like this.

Reisen:
Hmm...? And you were meditating in the bamboo forest, yes?

Mokou:
Yep. Looks like you don't know what's goin' on, huh?
'Course, I've got nothin' either.

Reisen:
(This has got to be the unusual event that Taoist was talking about!)

Mokou:
By the way, why are you at the shrine?

Reisen:
Mmm, well, you see‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
(Would telling her "I'm here to observe this abnormal phenomenon" be a good idea...?)

Mokou:
Looks like you know something. Any idea what happened to me just now?

Reisen:
Er, no, I really have no idea.

Mokou:
Hm, hm. There's no need to be so modest.
I've noticed some stuff recently.
You people at Eientei have been actin' suspicious for a little while.
Perhaps you're tryin' to use me as a test subject, 'cause I'm immortal?

Reisen:
No, no, really, we...

Mokou:
Hmph. Makin' a fool outta me.
You moon people are always lookin' down on us humans and youkai, aren'tcha?

Mokou:
Aaah, I'm gettin' real annoyed all of a sudden.

Reisen:
I, I see, well then I think I'll just be leaving now--

Mokou:
Just how stuck-up can you People of the Moon get?

Mokou:
Maybe I oughta give you a bad time, here. How's that sound?

Reisen:
I would really rather pass.

Mokou:
Sorry, not happening. Seems like the fire inside me's been having trouble keeping quiet for a while now.
Soar into the moon on the highest flames on Earth! And get back there!

Mokou:
-

Reimu:
A doppelganger? Whose urban legend is that?

Reimu:
It's not like your mysteries are stronger just because you've got more of them.

Reimu:
You lost because your urban legend is too minor.

Reimu:
I‚Äôm not sure why, but that look is awfully fitting for you.

Reimu:
Yeah, you broke the plate... Guess it figures you'd be cursed for that.

Reimu:
Hmm. I'm gonna defy expectations and say "blue"!

Reimu:
Maybe I should go with red after all?

Reimu:
You're going about this 'urban legend' thing the wrong way.

Reimu:
Can you not just turn down a phone call? Sounds like a pain.

Reimu:
Aliens are cuter than I expected.

Reimu:
By "Kuchisake-onna", do you mean that Hannya mask of yours?

Reimu:
You are basically human, right? Why are you on fire?

Reimu:
I'm gonna pour some hot water into that bowl. I might get a nice broth out of it.

Reimu:
If you can grant wishes with that paw, you don't need the Occult Balls.

Reimu:
Huh, you come over here in the flesh even when you‚Äôre dreaming.

Reimu:
So, basically...
The Lunar Capital's Occult Ball isn't yours, is it? What's up with that?

Reimu:
To solve the urban legend incident I wonder if I have to go to the lunar capital again.

Reimu:
Could it be that this incident has been caused by the reticent person on the moon? When will this incident end, I wonder.

Reimu:
Ahh... I just wanna crawl into a gap and disappear.

Reimu:
If I just go about things normally, there's no way I'll lose.

Marisa:
The Gap Woman really isn‚Äôt the kind of occult a protagonist ought'a choose.

Marisa:
Well...
It seems like there's one last secret hidden in the Power Stones.

Marisa:
I'm gonna do my best today, too!

Marisa:
Okay, so what does this giant lady of yours do?

Marisa:
Man, you really picked a daring urban legend. Awesome.

Marisa:
Here's one plate, two plates... By the way, what time is it?

Marisa:
I did hear about some "Red paper, Blue paper" thing once...

Marisa:
Where even is Loch Ness.....

Marisa:
Y'know, that aside, this Nessie of yours...
It looks way more expensive than Hisou Tensoku. Y'sure this is profitable?

Marisa:
Oh, I've heard of this. It's called stalking.

Marisa:
I feel like I've been implanted with something.

Marisa:
I just gotta say "pomade," huh? Pomade, pomade.

Marisa:
I guess stuff still hurts, even if you're immortal. Why're ya burnin' yourself? Are you into that kinda stuff?

Marisa:
I've heard of a green giant, but a green inchling ain't scary at all.

Marisa:
No matter how you look at it, that‚Äôs not a monkey‚Äôs paw.

Marisa:
When exactly do you sleep?

Marisa:
When ya come over here, come to my place or Reimu's. The others are dangerous in all kinds a' ways.

Marisa:
By the way, did you know that some moon rabbits stayed on the ground?

Marisa:
I've met the dango-loving moon rabbit a lot, but I've also encountered a handful other moon rabbits. I guess moon rabbits can come and go as they like it.

Marisa:
Behold! These are the seven mysteries of the school!

Ichirin:
Is a Gap Woman like when you roll up the mat covering the floorboards and in the gap you see women packed up in there... Is that like, it?

Ichirin:
Your urban legend comes off as childish, somehow.

Ichirin:
Popopopo...

Ichirin:
"Turbo Granny"...? "Granny"? Pfft, heh heh.

Ichirin:
Oh, never mind that! The way you woosh around is really cool. Just what I'd expect!

Ichirin:
That's so old-fashioned! I mean, Okiku-san? Really.

Ichirin:
Hm, maybe red... Wait, what‚Äôre you up to?!

Ichirin:
I want blue! Wait, what‚Äôre you up to?!

Ichirin:
Wow, were there really such big creatures back in ancient times...?

Ichirin:
...Yes, hello. I'm standing behind you, too.

Ichirin:
Now this is a genuine UFO...

Ichirin:
This has been bothering me, but....
I do understand the UFOs, but what urban legend might you be trying to imitate?

Ichirin:
Even if my mouth was slit, I could never go around asking ‚ÄúAm I pretty?‚Äù

Ichirin:
Human bodies sure can burn. I wonder what they're made of.

Ichirin:
Since there‚Äôs no water, do you even need that bowl?

Ichirin:
That needle was custom-made, right? In that case, you would have been better off getting a different weapon....

Ichirin:
I can have three wishes granted... Three, huh? I wonder what to wish for.

Ichirin:
What's an "internet", anyway? Ah, is it about "Heaven's nets are vast, yet let nothing through"?

Ichirin:
Huh? So Hassaku-sama is an urban legend that was created on the internet only just recently?

Ichirin:


Ichirin:


Ichirin:
...Poppopoppopopo.

Ichirin:
...Popoppopoppo. That folks, was my pigeon impression!

Byakuren:
So the Gap Woman cuts those gaps open, is that the type of apparition she is?

Byakuren:
By school, you mean a temple right? Because I do know about the Seven Temple Mysteries.

Byakuren:
Just as I was thinking you'd been neglecting your training lately, here I find you goofing off....

Byakuren:
I have claimed the title of the fastest!

Byakuren:
Didn't you break too many dishes? You will get yelled at for that, you know.

Byakuren:
Red covers you with blood, blue drains you of blood... What does that accomplish?

Byakuren:
Oh, this monster is, well. Looking closely, it‚Äôs been sloppily constructed through and through...

Byakuren:
Nessie is an UMA, right.
There‚Äôs an UMA-ish creature at our temple too, though I wonder if they could become friends.

Byakuren:
Oh! Could you not sneak up behind me?

Byakuren:
Did you abandon Bunbuku Chagama? And I who was going to do some boiling.

Byakuren:
Even if I say you‚Äôre pretty, you‚Äôll still attack me.

Byakuren:
Here is yet another individual who has departed from the cycle of death and rebirth...... Or, could this perhaps also be enlightenment?

Byakuren:
You have crammed those green little men into that bowl, haven‚Äôt you.

Byakuren:
Here we are yet again.... As it appears that you are another hermit with different inclinations, compared to Miko.

Byakuren:
Truly, Gensokyo is but a fleeting dream. To you, it must be ephemeral.

Byakuren:
Oh dear!
Is the capital highway really so crowded you can‚Äôt ever battle there? Do tell me all about it!

Byakuren:


Byakuren:
Tonight again, I gotta go 100 kilometers!

Byakuren:
All is but a fleeting dream. Namu sanbou, namu sanbou.

Byakuren:
Naturally anyone would start longing for a battle on the capital highway while riding on this bike.
I have no clue where it is, though.

Futo:
If thou hast a moment, could you perhaps compass me a dish through the gaps?

Futo:
How rather unrefined... Considering that it's occult, it ought to be more, you know....

Futo:
It appears size was the only thing of merit here.

Futo:
What is that vehicle? Is it comfortable?

Futo:
Ten plates... 
Huh? Here's the tenth plate?

Futo:
Aye ma‚Äôam, allow me to shoulder the responsibility of tidying up the plates.

Futo:
T'was quite a bizarre monstrosity

Futo:
To sneak behind someone unnoticed... I say, so this is what they call a telephone.

Futo:
Aliens, you say? So why pray tell, are they are nude despite being spacers?

Futo:
Thine mouth arn't particularly torn, 'tis not.

Futo:
S‚Äôrry to have ya guide me through the bamboo thicket. See, 'tis always so easy to get lost in there.

Futo:
So you are immortal, you say?
Just how you‚Äôve escaped the shinigami‚Äôs grip is what I‚Äôd like to hear.

Futo:
Dish and bowl. T'is be akin to a war of the dining table.

Futo:
Oh, who do we have here if not the esteemed mountain hermit! Are you no better armed than this?

Futo:
Since this be but a dream, do you feel pain?

Futo:
I have heard about the state of the world we currently live in. 
To bethink that there exists yet another world outside ours! Reality truly goes far beyond mine own imagination.

Futo:


Futo:
One plate, two plates, three plates....

Futo:
Eight plates, nine plates... No matter how many times I count, there are never enough.

Miko:
Gaps exist to be entered, am I right? Indulge yourself to your heart‚Äôs content.

Miko:
If you don‚Äôt study properly in school, you will be disadvantaged in the future.

Miko:
That sound, is it the cooing of a pigeon?

Miko:
A red mantle and a rampaging vehicle... This is almost akin to the bullfights of faraway lands.

Miko:
No matter how much time passes, your way of thinking will always be so damn trite.

Miko:
As for me, I‚Äôd like the purple mantle. As in the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System.

Miko:
In case someone asked for the secret alternative orange mantle, I had prepared a mikan as a gift. ....But everyone's been faithful to the alternatives.

Miko:
Kappa nowadays sure can make all sorts of machines.

Miko:
Rather than machines, you would do better to treasure animals.

Miko:
So, that phone was your true callin-... Never mind.

Miko:
I see the tanuki also become strong youkai if they live many years.

Miko:
Are there truly aliens trapped within those balls?

Miko:
Whilst hidden behind a mask, how can one rehabilitate.

Miko:
By now, you ought to be familiar with your new mask right?

Miko:
To think that the elixir of immortality has already been made...

Miko:
The tales of the Fujiwara‚Äôs wickedness have reached mine ears. Allow me to take care of the rest.

Miko:
That sure is a big needle. If you use that you wouldn't just impale someone‚Äôs eye, you‚Äôd impale their head as well.

Miko:
Ah, the hermit of the mountain. I won't interfere with a kindred spirit.

Miko:
If you truly are dreaming right now, then how in the world do you perceive our existence?

Miko:
But never mind that.
On the outside where as much as 1400 years have passed, do the people still speak rightly of my exploits?

Miko:
Tell those of Eientei. Now, a strange event will soon occur.

Miko:
Be it red cape, or be it blue cape? Choose the one you wish for!

Miko:
You want red, hm? If so, you shall die!

Miko:
I see, I see. So blue is what you want? If so, you shall die!

Nitori:
You sure know how to pick a niche phenomenon, huh.

Nitori:
I don‚Äôt really get what schools are all about.

Nitori:
Would you care for a new broom? The price remains the same as 32 years ago!

Nitori:
I'm not gonna lose in a contest of size! Not by a long shot!

Nitori:
W-what is that vehicle....? Oh, I am highly interested in this yet-to-be discovered technology.

Nitori:
Ah, are you in the market for plates? If you order now, we'll throw in one free plate with every nine purchased!

Nitori:
If you‚Äôre giving ‚Äòem away for free, then I‚Äôll take both red and blue.

Nitori:
That was Generic Kappa A!

Nitori:
That was an illusion caused by my tired eyes!

Nitori:
A-a mobile phone? I see, so that‚Äôs a way of using Urban Legends...

Nitori:
These low-tech aliens are no good!

Nitori:
Allow me to show you our new selection of masks. They would all look great on you!

Nitori:
Our machines are inflammable after all.

Nitori:
Unbelievable. So you're the one who's been going fishing on our turf.

Nitori:
You can understand what my Nessie‚Äôs saying? Really?

Nitori:
Could you please let Miss Reimu have it?
She‚Äôll just be interfering with our business, so tell her to not do anything weird.

Nitori:
You‚Äôre so behind on the times you don‚Äôt even have waterproof tools.

Nitori:
A smartphone? What, it‚Äôs not waterproof? Not interested.

Nitori:
You‚Äôve sure got a lot of interesting stuff. Hey, come on and show me!

Nitori:


Nitori:


Nitori:
This high occult energy is all going to Nessie!

Nitori:
The Occult Ball Energy conversion rate is less than 5%. What the hell‚Äôs going on, that's way too low!

Koishi:
Even if I go to the shrine, no one will notice me.

Koishi:
It's as if I'm the one in a gap.

Koishi:
Your hat looks really heavy. What'cha got in there?

Koishi:
It must be nice to be so healthy... Maybe I should live on the surface too!

Koishi:
I love that vehicle! Lemme ride it!

Koishi:
Oh yeah, there‚Äôs a girl at your temple called Minamitsu, right? She still can‚Äôt forget the charm of the Hell of Blood Pools, so she visits sometimes. Didja know?

Koishi:
Yes, the tenth plate you desire is right behind you...

Koishi:
I want the blue one!

Koishi:
Even if you say you have everlasting youth and life, you really will die, right? Everyone does.

Koishi:
Hey, Miss shopkeeper! I really want that monster!

Koishi:
Hello, hello! I'm right behind me, too.

Koishi:
‚ÄòTis ball.... ‚ÄòTis ain‚Äôt no Occult Ball... but an Alien Ball!

Koishi:
I‚Äôm prettier than you anyway!

Koishi:
Even if you say you‚Äôre immortal
you‚Äôll die eventually, right? Everyone does.

Koishi:
I wanna get inside that bowl, too!

Koishi:
Aha, so you haven‚Äôt cleaned up your stuff in there! Oh, I totally get it! I‚Äôm terrible with cleaning, too!

Koishi:
You can wish for 3 things right? Hmm, I think I'd want everything, nothing, and anything...

Koishi:
You can wish for 3 things right? No question, I want Past, Present and Future...

Koishi:
Your mobile phone? I‚Äôve got something like that. I‚Äôve been at a loss for what to do lately though.

Koishi:
Eh? You‚Äôre dreaming right now? How fantastic, I‚Äôm appearing in someone‚Äôs dream!

Koishi:
Oh, miss Rabbit. Hello there. So you can see me from those eyes of yours.

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Right now, I've just beaten you.

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Right now, I'm on top of your back.

Koishi:
Hello, hello! Right now, I‚Äôm stepping over your corpse as I try to advance into the future.

Mamizou:
Transforming into you is no pickle! ‚ÄòCause yer somehow tanuki-like n‚Äô all.

Mamizou:
The Seven School Mysteries, now that takes me down memory lane. The youngsters who were spooked by that sort‚Äôa twaddle ain‚Äôt around no more, either.

Mamizou:
Now ain‚Äôt that jolly stylish. ‚ÄòS there something or other goin‚Äô on at the temple?

Mamizou:
.......I have the right to remain silent.

Mamizou:
Ain‚Äôt the granny supposed to hurdle down the highway on ‚Äòer own two feet?

Mamizou:
With just one or two of them plates, ya sure can roughhouse around, fer cryin‚Äô out loud...

Mamizou:
I‚Äôll keep on tellin‚Äô ya. Feng-shui makes use of the power of nature, but what we‚Äôve got‚Äôs power that transcends the natural.

Mamizou:
I‚Äôd fancy a brown mantle.

Mamizou:
Well, waddaya know! Occult power‚Äôs what‚Äôs powering Nessie?

Mamizou:
A satori who ain‚Äôt fitted to read minds, why that ain‚Äôt no different from a tanuki unfit to transform into a human!

Mamizou:
I ain‚Äôt fond of them mobile phones... Y‚Äôsee, them letters‚Äôre too teeny-tiny.

Mamizou:
This ain't no good, no good at all! We'll befuddle which one‚Äôs the real deal!

Mamizou:
Yes, yes. Pomade, pomade.

Mamizou:
‚ÄòCause the bamboo forest‚Äôs the rabbits‚Äô turf, I ain‚Äôt very fond of it.

Mamizou:
Nevertheless.... Immortality‚Äôs nothing but a load‚Äôa hogwash.

Mamizou:
Issun Boushi over here sure had me flabbergasted.

Mamizou:
Weren‚Äôt the green inchlings just some kinda make-believe or whatnot?

Mamizou:
The monkey‚Äôs paw, the kappa‚Äôs arm n‚Äô the mermaid's mummy: Those‚Äôre the three fantastical sundries.

Mamizou:
There‚Äôs this cultural movement on the outside where folks praise them power spots.
That devotion‚Äôs what powering them occult balls.

Mamizou:
This ain‚Äôt sleepwalking per se. Dreaming disease‚Äôs what I‚Äôd say.

Mamizou:
By the by, are ya rightly pursuing those academics, eh? The bygone years of ignorant folks‚Äôre miserable, ya know?
What ya humans need ain‚Äôt abundant knowledge nor flexible manners of thinking. A will to learn n‚Äô humility's what ya need.

Mamizou:
I hate rabbits.

Mamizou:
Beasts who cannot transform have no future.

Mamizou:
That ought'a do it for today.

Mamizou:
Them alien capsules that were used as playthings by youngsters on the outside is what‚Äôve used as inspiration.

Kokoro:
Gya! There's a woman in the gap between my face and my mask!
Oops, wrong mask. Here‚Äôs the one for surprise.

Kokoro:
Hey, gimme that principal‚Äôs mask(?).

Kokoro:
Popopo~n. Where did that originate?

Kokoro:
Uwaa, you startled me! A weird old lady on a motorbike!?
Uuum, I got the wrong mask... This is the mask for surprise.

Kokoro:
I'll let you borrow a plate from me. This is just too miserable...

Kokoro:
I want the pink cape!

Kokoro:
Uwaaaa, what a huge monster! I thought my heart was gonna stop...
Um, ummm... I gotta put on my surprised mask!

Kokoro:
I have faces pointed in all directions. Even if you sneak up behind me, I'm not gonna be surprised!

Kokoro:
Aliens are so cute! Would this be the right expression for times like this, I wonder?

Kokoro:
I‚Äôm the only one who knows that in reality, there‚Äôs someone among us using the Doppelganger occult.

Kokoro:
I don't think I really understand the concept of dying or not dying...

Kokoro:
Are you the master of that reversed castle? Construction defects sure are awful.

Kokoro:
What happens if all three wishes are granted?

Kokoro:
Those bandages... Do even scars occasionally hurt, I wonder?

Kokoro:
You‚Äôre a young human, right. I'm truly jealous of hopeful youths...

Kokoro:
The Outside World, huh. I'm truly jealous of hopeful worlds...

Kokoro:
What a scary red eye.

Kokoro:
What a scary red eye. What's this...
I feel overwhelmed by some complicated emotions. Is this the feeling of madness?

Kokoro:
Hey, hey. Am I pretty?

Kokoro:
Hey, hey. Do you think I'm pretty?

Kokoro:
Hey, hey. I'm pretty, right?

Mokou:
Was it you? The one who dragged me into this Occult nonsense.

Mokou:
Now that you mention it, I did some asking around over at Eientei.
Seems like you're about to get dragged into some troublesome, nightmarish job.

Mokou:
Give it up. Immortality is lonely and inescapable.

Mokou:
If monks had actually been saving people, this world would‚Äôve become a paradise long ago.

Mokou:
Well? Won‚Äôt you read a sutra for me, the one dying over and over?

Mokou:
Okiku-san, huh? Even if she couldn't reach enlightenment, that doesn't change the fact that she's dead.

Mokou:
You're immortal too, you say...?

Mokou:
I have no idea what the hell you people attaining immortality are thinking.

Mokou:
I'll evaporate every last drop of moisture from you.

Mokou:
You‚Äôre a youkai from underground? No wonder I thought you were an unusual one.

Mokou:
That tail looks like it'd burn up nicely.

Mokou:
Your face isn't smiling, you know? You're scary.

Mokou:
After all this time, there‚Äôs nothing left that can scare m- Wah, that‚Äôs me!

Mokou:
You‚Äôre the only one out of us wearing a big shield. Take that off and fight fairly!

Mokou:
I see, so what you‚Äôre saying is that hermits gain longevity by fighting off shinigami.

Mokou:
You‚Äôre dreaming? But weren‚Äôt you visiting for real just the other day?

Mokou:
Did you get sent that lost thing from the other day?
I see. Oh, so it was a chain letter. ...wait, what?

Mokou:
The Lunarian bunch again? Give me a break. Should I take one of my lives and attack that place?

Mokou:
I don't even care about this Occult nonsense...

Mokou:
I‚Äôve had way too damn much of these kinda happenings.

Mokou:
It would appear that....
There's someone who's stuck me with the Urban Legend of spontaneous combustion.

Shinmyoumaru:
I'm gonna take that gap and sew it up!

Shinmyoumaru:
I can't use such a big bathroom.

Shinmyoumaru:
8 Shaku.... 1 Shaku is 10 sun, so that's times 80....

Shinmyoumaru:
"Issun Boushi & Hasshaku-sama". If you go by their names, it somehow sounds like they‚Äôd be friends.

Shinmyoumaru:
I‚Äôve also got my own ride, hmph!

Shinmyoumaru:
Lemme borrow a plate? I can spin it on my needle and everything!

Shinmyoumaru:
I‚Äôm not scared of no Urban Legend about having your blood drawn! And I don‚Äôt want either red nor blue, hmph.

Shinmyoumaru:
This thing on my head isn‚Äôt a plate! I‚Äôm not a kappa! I‚Äôm really not!

Shinmyoumaru:
Gyaaaa, she was right behind meee!

Shinmyoumaru:
In the stories, tanuki often become tanuki-soup at the end.

Shinmyoumaru:
If I fill this bowl with tanuki-soup, I bet the smell would never come out...

Shinmyoumaru:
It‚Äôs so boring they don‚Äôt even make masks my size.

Shinmyoumaru:
Hot, hot, hot! If I didn't have a heat resistant bowl, I would'a been cooked up!

Shinmyoumaru:
Hooray! I beat me!

Shinmyoumaru:
You? A hermit? Huh. Smells fishy to me.

Shinmyoumaru:
When I‚Äôm looking at you, just feel like I wanna poke your eyes out, see. No idea why though.

Shinmyoumaru:
Gyaa, it's that pervert! Run awaaay!

Shinmyoumaru:
So, you‚Äôre saying you can‚Äôt catch me because you‚Äôre dreaming right now? Still, I will run awaaay!

Shinmyoumaru:
So you are a rabbit from the moon? Tell me about that place.

Shinmyoumaru:
Please, stop putting that cute thing in your mortar! That's my role!

Shinmyoumaru:
The small should just band together with the big.

Shinmyoumaru:
I'm gonna collect them all and get bigger!

Kasen:
Want to train at my place again? It'll be the Reptile Course this time.

Kasen:
It‚Äôs as if you don‚Äôt know how to use magic properly. You will die eventually, you know?

Kasen:
"Hasshaku-sama"? Does that mean you're holding a shakuhachi backwards?

Kasen:
If "Hasshaku"-sama refers to a "shakuhachi" held backwards...
Then is the 'popopo' sound the noise that comes from the shakuhachi when you play it poorly...? I see.

Kasen:
A m-motorcycle? An old granny on a motorcycle is definitely bizarre.

Kasen:
I'd really prefer not to be lumped together with such a low-level hermit.

Kasen:
Got any cinnabar? I'm running a little low.

Kasen:
Well, the kappa never change...

Kasen:
Go teach Reimu some business.
She's just dreadful to watch.

Kasen:
Oh, you're the young missy from the Palace. Your big sister's been worried about you.

Kasen:
As expected, tanuki are both inedible and hard to tame.

Kasen:
You're performing noh this year too, right? This year‚Äôs performance is going to be Kuchisake-onna, as expected?

Kasen:
Oh, poor, lonely departed one who even the shinigami no longer target. I can sympathize.

Kasen:
You setting yourself on fire would equal a mock-cremation.
I will name this ‚ÄúSpontaneous Human Combustion‚Äù.

Kasen:
Was this the one with the seven green dwarfs?

Kasen:
Could this be some kind of supernatural phenomenon?

Kasen:
To think this is only your dream... Just what force is at work here?

Kasen:
You can‚Äôt fool me!
You‚Äôre hiding your own true Urban Legend, aren‚Äôt you?

Kasen:


Kasen:
I heard from Reimu.
Apparently this urban legend incident was caused by the People of the Moon. Was this your doing?

Kasen:
There's no way I'd reveal my full strength at a time like this.

Kasen:
If the monkey's paw can grant wishes, then I...
I think I'll just stick with the monkey's paw.

Sumireko:
The gap woman, really? How unfit for a protagonist!

Sumireko:
The shrine's so cozy. Thanks for always letting me hide out there!

Sumireko:
Recently, it appears that ‚Äúthe student who gets straight A‚Äôs despite always sleeping‚Äù might become one of my school‚Äôs Seven Mysteries.

Sumireko:
Among the seven mysteries at my school we‚Äôve got one about the vice principal's hairdo flying through the sky.

Sumireko:
Even though Hasshaku-sama was an Urban Legend born on the internet... She still bled through into this world as well.

Sumireko:
So like in the online Urban Legends, if an old man or a priest or someone like that pops out the story just falls apart, 'cause they're too OP, really.

Sumireko:
...Huh? Turbo Granny? Is that a motorcycle gang?

Sumireko:
I went and looked it up online! It appears that Turbo Granny runs on her own two legs.
 What you have here must be something like a mix-up with Ghost R*der.

Sumireko:
Okiku-san and Oiwa-san like, always get mixed with each other, huh.

Sumireko:
‚ÄúBanshuu Dish Mansion‚Äù and ‚ÄúBanchou Dish Mansion‚Äù, too. You‚Äôre bound to end up confusing them!

Sumireko:
The basis for my outfit is the elusive Red Mantle!

Sumireko:
The elusive Red Mantle is pretty dreamy! There‚Äôs a surprising amount of girls who‚Äôre into that.

Sumireko:
I feel as if Nessie has spoiled the story for me...

Sumireko:
If the bottom of Loch Ness is connected to another world like Gensokyo.... Then even Nessie won‚Äôt be a dream!

Sumireko:
Mary-san? Can't you just block her number?

Sumireko:
Frankly, this is the type of horror I dislike the most. Because perverts like this seem like they‚Äôd exist in real life.

Sumireko:
Intelligent aliens do exist, no doubt. That's what plenty of people believe.

Sumireko:
Intelligent aliens do exist, no doubt. That's what plenty of people believe, but... 
Here‚Äôs my assertion as a science expert:
Intellectual aliens whom humanity can make contact with do not exist in this universe!

Sumireko:
What's "pomade"? Um, it sounds like something really old.

Sumireko:
I was assuming maybe you had hay fever...

Sumireko:
One of the causes of the spontaneous combustion phenomenon is actually thought to be ball lightning.

Sumireko:
Huh? Immortal? Now that part of you is definitely occult!

Sumireko:
I caught you! I wonder if I can take you home with me even though I‚Äôm dreaming...

Sumireko:
I don't want a green man, though.

Sumireko:
The monkey's paw... The paw that grants any wish, no matter what it is... Gulp...

Sumireko:
Yakiniku and Sushi and... What should the last one be, I wonder?

Sumireko:
Sleeping is really just about changing places with your other self, it's no different from a switcheroo.

Sumireko:
The Doppelganger... Yes. This is my true Occult.

Sumireko:
Oh, a bunny girl, kinda feels like the Showa era?

Sumireko:
Kunekune?! The thing that must absolutely not be seen? That's an absolutely different image... It's surprisingly cute.

Sumireko:
Please don't tell me this battle was just a dream!

Sumireko:
Sigh. When I wake up, it‚Äôs back to Japanese Class... That‚Äôs just so super-dull.

Sumireko:
Uh-oh, I injured myself. Oh well, it‚Äôs just a dream.
Wait.....? Did the bruises from before go away, or....

Reisen:
I understand that you don't trust the Lunar Capital. Neither do I.

Reisen:
You're an odd one. Won't focusing on one of the seven wonders make the legend stronger?

Reisen:
When you look at me, I'm also a type of maddening occult. Sure, it might be cheap, but it's the latest fad after all.

Reisen:
My master told me that we should keep a good relationship with your temple.

Reisen:
Though I've been told that we need to keep a good relationship with your temple...
I was also told that I shouldn't get too close to the place, because the smell of something dead is coming out of it.

Reisen:
An occult about dishes? How old-fashioned! This sort of hard-headed person I don't want to deal with!

Reisen:
Where is your training hall? I always have trouble finding your entrance.

Reisen:
I wonder if red would be a good pick, but blue could be new, yeah. I can't decide.

Reisen:
My master sampled some of your medicine. That's some praise for you. She said they're the epitome of folk remedies.

Reisen:
Come to think of it...
It looks like there's an unfamiliar, polluting object inside the Kappa medicine. ...A Shirikodama, perhaps?

Reisen:
What did you say?! Even if you look at the kunekune directly, you won't lose your mind? Ah, you've already lost it?

Reisen:
Have you ever seen a real alien? If you come to my home, I'll show you one.

Reisen:
In the end, we're the same.
In old stories, often the villains are both rabbits and tanuki. Why is that?

Reisen:
I wonder, who even made the mask of the Kuchisake Onna?

Reisen:
There's a moon-viewing at Eientei now. Why don't you come visit sometime?

Reisen:
There's a moon-viewing at Eientei now. Why don't you come join us? Kaguya recommended it.
I know you don't want to come because of many this and thats but let's have bygones be bygones already, okay?

Reisen:
Wow, it's a little person!

Reisen:
The monkey's hand... I want it!

Reisen:
Your wavelength, it's terribly long.
Despite your abundant emotion, it hides something cold, inhuman...

Reisen:
ESP? If this is about a multiplication technique, I can do that too. ...Wait, wouldn't that be Ninjutsu?

Reisen:
Just because the Kunekune sits inside a mortar, that doesn't make it mochi.

Reisen:
Hattifattener...No, that's not it. It must be the kunekune.

Reisen:
This urban legend thing is totally becoming a game to me.

Reisen:
The kunekune, it's pretty cute up close, but upon seeing it you'll lose your mind.

Reimu:
What is this? They aren't usually this intense.

???:
Even if you're not in the way, I'll shoot!

Seiran:
This is Seiran. I've made contact with a belligerent earthling.
Now proceeding with purification.

Reimu:
Talking to yourself? Creepy.

Seiran:
Too bad for you, filthy earthling.

Seiran:
Earth (This place) is about to be purified!

Seiran:
Ghhh... This is why I didn't want to be in the ground troops„Éº

Reimu:
Wait, are you a moon rabbit?
Purifying the Earth... I've got a really bad feeling about this.
Tell me where your base is! Or else...

Seiran:
Please, spare me! If I tell, they'll kill me!
If I tell you about our forward base on the mountain lake, they'll kill me!

Reimu:
So this is the moon rabbit from before's base, huh...?

???:
I've been waiting for you„Éº

Ringo:
I heard about you from Seiran. She said she'd engaged an interesting person...
Huh? I feel like I've seen you before.

Reimu:
Well, I sure don't know you.

Ringo:
...Did you come to the Lunar Capital a while ago?

Reimu:
I s-suppose.

Ringo:
This is interesting! Looks like I can play with you without holding back!
Stand in awe of the moon's style of fighting (Lunatic) , where not even taking a single hit (making a single mistake) is allowed!

Reimu:
I'm just getting started here! You could have held back a little.

Ringo:
Ahh, there are some pretty strong people on Earth, huh?
You've got all sorts of food, too. I wish I had been born on Earth...

Reimu:
Um... What in the world is going on now?

Ringo:
We've come to purify Gensokyo, but...
...us moon rabbits (underlings) don't really care about that.

Reimu:
Huh.

Ringo:
You'll have to go and work things out on your own.
Now, to the Lunar Capital (Lunatic Kingdom) !

Reimu:
The moon is so close...

???:
Well, look who it is.

Doremy:
If it isn't Gensokyo's shrine maiden.
This is a quite powerful nightmare, isn't it? ...Wait.
Your physical body!? Is that your physical body?!

Reimu:
Uh... I suppose it is?

Doremy:
For your physical body to break into the Dream World like this...
...have you been caught in some kind of trap?

Reimu:
T-trap? I was heading towards the Lunar Capital...

Doremy:
The Lunar Capital... Oh-ho, I see now.

Doremy:
Very well. I will dispose of this lunatic dream.
Now, sleep. I will craft your Kaian now.

Doremy:
I've disposed of all the nightmares up to this point.
You must have a strong will to maintain control over your body through this.

Reimu:
What are you?

Doremy:
I am a baku. A resident of this Dream World.
You said you were heading towards the Lunar Capital? And with your physical body, too.
There, a nightmare unlike any you have encountered before now awaits you.
It is worthy of being called a 'lunatic dream'.
Prepare yourself well, dreaming human of the physical world.

Reimu:
...I don't really get it, but...
...I guess the Lunar Capital and Gensokyo are connected through the dream world?

Reimu:
Is this the Lunar Capital...?
It seems really different than the last time I came here.
Almost like the whole city has been frozen or something.

Sagume:
...

Reimu:
Uhhh.

Sagume:
...ah, a human?
...

Reimu:
Can you not talk!?
Look, I'm not sure what's going on here in the Capital,
but you're the one conducting the invasion of Gensokyo, aren't you?

Sagume:
Mm. Well, that's true...

Reimu:
You confessed. You confessed so easily.

Sagume:
...just what is your role here?
...whoops. If I talk too much, it'll ruin the plan.
......

Reimu:
Clamming up again, huh? Fine. There's only one thing for me to do.
Time to beat you up and resolve this incident!

Sagume:
I now understand why you were sent here.
I'm sure it was on Lady Yagokoro's suggestion.
You're terribly strong. Perhaps with you...

Reimu:
Looks like attacking you got you to talk real fast.

Sagume:
My name is Sagume.
I have the power to change the direction of the world with my words.
So when things are going well, I can't talk too much.
"Least said, soonest mended," after all.

Reimu:
Huh. Okay, but if you're talking all of a sudden...

Sagume:
A new development will surely occur soon, through terribly destructive means.
I'm throwing my lot in with you. You'll be the destroyer.

Reimu:
Excuse me?
You're the ones who were attacking Gensokyo, right? I'd say you're the destroyers.

Sagume:
The Lunar Capital is what's really under attack.
Via a method that renders us people of the moon unable to act, to boot.
I was considering migrating to Gensokyo to prevent us from being wiped out.
The people of the moon aren't aware of any of this, though.

Reimu:
The Lunar Capital gets invaded, so you invade Gensokyo in turn?
Real opportunistic attitude you've got there.

Sagume:
However, that fate has begun to be overturned right now.
Our migration to Gensokyo will surely go unrealized.
In exchange, you, an earthling, shall save the Lunar Capital!
I shall now put it into words. You can no longer escape from fate.
Fate has begun to turn over. Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!

???:
Kyahahahaha! Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies! Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic tiiiime! Welcome to a world of madness!

Reimu:
Looks like I wound up somewhere really desolate.
That aside, I'm supposed to save the Lunar Capital? The story's gotten kind of weird somehow.
The fairies around here are hustling way more than usual, too.
I guess you can find the squirts just about anywhere.

???:
Not quiiite.
Usually, the moon's near side (Surface Moon) is a lifeless world. It can't even produce fairies.

Reimu:
Oh, you again. Although you look sort of fairy-like, too.

Clownpiece:
Yes! I'm a fairy from hell, Clownpiece!
You're the first visitor we've had since honorable friend gave us this land!

Reimu:
Gave you the land? Where exactly is this?

Clownpiece:
The surface moon is the outer side of the Lunar Capital. It's way more comfortable than hell!

Reimu:
Well, yeah. Compared to hell, just about anywhere would be paradise.

Clownpiece:
Oh, right. Honorable friend told me something.
"If anyone comes from the Lunar Capital, show them no mercy!"

Reimu:
What, you? A fairy? Do you have any idea who I am?

Clownpiece:
Noooo idea.

Reimu:
I'm the Hakurei shrine maiden who silences crying children!

Clownpiece:
Well, I'm not gonna cry. I'm a hell fairy, right?
If I had to say, I think I'd be the one making people cry, y'know~?
Ooh, I got a good idea just now. How about I make you cry and silence you?

Clownpiece:
Hah, hah, hah...

Reimu:
Game set, already! You lost!

Clownpiece:
W-why...?
But I heard that as long as we fairies, symbols of life, controlled this place,
the people of the moon wouldn't be able to do a thing.

Reimu:
That reminds me. The lady from before...
...mentioned "a method that renders us unable to act," too.

Clownpiece:
Hey, lady... uh, I mean, madam? Who exactly are you?

Reimu:
Didn't you hear me before?

Reimu:
An Earthling who makes silent children cry! The Hakurei shrine maiden! That's twice, now!

Clownpiece:
Mm. Got it.
So, what's a shrine maiden doing here?

Reimu:
Uh, well.
I came here looking for whoever's invading Gensokyo, but...
At some point I wound up having to save the Lunar Capital.

Clownpiece:
So you are in league with the moon's people! Which means you're an enemy of our honorable friend.
An enemy of honorable friend is an enemy of Master's. And any enemy of Master's is an enemy of mine!
...but, I'm not really sure what to do. I've got no fight left in me.

Reimu:
For starters, how about you guide me to this... friend?
I've sort of lost track of my actual goal, here.

???:
No matter how many countermeasures I work out, you overcome them.
'Tis a shame. My nemesis was nearly within reach.

Reimu:
You're the ringleader of the invasion of the Lunar Capital, huh?

???:
For now, I shall admit defeat.

Reimu:
Wha?

???:
For not one moment did I ever expect that they would send an earthling to the moon.
I'm surprised that the people of the moon, hating even the slightest impurity, would use such a haphazard method.
I underestimated them. The battle has already been decided.

Reimu:
You seem real relaxed, even though the fight is still to come.

Junko:
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.
If I may be frank, my current will to fight has vanished...
However, I shall at least show you some hospitality for arriving here.
It is only polite, is it not?

Reimu:
To be honest, I don't really care one bit about the Lunar Capital...
But I've got to at least vent a little about having been given so much trouble!
Plus, you're sort of annoying somehow.

Junko:
Though she now lives on another heavenly body, and I am unable to meet with her...
Even if we are unable to dwell together under Heaven, my hatred alone will be refined.
Now, show me! Just what an earthling risking her life is capable of!
And behold! This pristine spiritual force that rejects life and death!

???:
No matter how many countermeasures I work out, you overcome them.
However, it seems your foolish scheme has ended in failure.

Reimu:
You're the ringleader of the invasion of the Lunar Capital, right?

???:
Verily.

Reimu:
All right! I dunno what's going on, but I'm gonna beat you and save the Lunar Capital!

???:
The people of the moon escape into a dream, and send an earthling to deal with me.
I thought it to be a daring plan, but I suppose I overestimated them.

Reimu:
Huh...?

???:
A human so completely surrounded by the stench of death can never hope to defeat me.

Junko:
My name is Junko.
With my power of purification, I am able to kill you unconditionally.
Just how many mistakes have you suffered on the way here?

Reimu:
Guh. It shouldn't have been that many...
(That reminds me. Eirin did say that I couldn't defeat these enemies without her drug...
The side effects sounded kinda scary, though, so I wound up not using it.)

Junko:
The moon's people, too, have committed a foolish mistake.
It seems this earthling is far more weak than you all thought.
My stagnated engagement with the people of the moon was just beginning to exhaust my interest.
My mortal enemy, Chang'e. Are you watching!? Gaze upon this poor soul as she struggles between life and death!

Marisa:
Some new faces I'm seeing running around here.

???:
It's inevitable! I'm attacking.

Seiran:
This is Seiran. I've made contact with a belligerent earthling.

Seiran:
Now proceeding with purification.

Marisa:
What's up with you? Who are you talking to?

Seiran:
I have no need to answer.

Seiran:
Because shortly, I will exterminate you!

Seiran:
Man, earthlings sure are strong...

Seiran:
I really was in bad luck when I lost that rock-paper-scissors game.

Marisa:
If you're saying "earthlings", that means... You're a Moon rabbit, aren't you?

Seiran:
That's right. I've received an order to purify Earth.

Marisa:
Ah, I see, that's why Eirin asked us to do this.

Marisa:
For some reason, the fairies' attacks are more violent than usual.

Marisa:
Guess I shoulda just listened to what Eirin said after all.

???:
I've been waiting for you„Éº

Ringo:
I heard about you from Seiran. She said she'd engaged an interesting person...

Marisa:
You're a Moon rabbit too?
Eirin told me that someone is attacking us from the Moon.

Ringo:
Guess so. But we're here not exactly to attack you.
Rather, we're here to purify.

Ringo:
Well, whatever. I should finish my job and take a breather.
Earthlings, who are allowed to get hit, cannot possibly understand our hard work„Éº

Ringo:
Oh, you're strong.

Marisa:
Woah, that was intense all of a sudden. I'm not lookin' forward to what's up next.

Ringo:
What are you going to do now?

Marisa:
Huh? What d'you mean by that?

Ringo:
Well, the Earth is going to be purified soon...

Marisa:
I'm thinkin' I'll just go stop the Lunar Capital's aggression.

Ringo:
If you're that strong, you might as well go there.
To the crazed Pure Land, the Lunar Capital (Lunatic Kingdom) .

Marisa:
I was at the lake just a while ago... What is this place?

???:
Oh, my.

Doremy:
The magician from Gensokyo, hm? What dream will you be having toda...
Wait, your physical body!? Is that your physical body!?

Marisa:
I think it still is.

Doremy:
For your physical body to break into the Dream World like this...
...have you been caught in some kind of trap?

Marisa:
Trap? Aw, so that really was a trap.
Even though there's a giant moon right in front of me, too!

Doremy:
Are you seeing the Moon? Oh-ho, I see now.

Doremy:
Very well. I will dispose of this lunatic dream.
Now, sleep. I will craft your Kaian now.

Doremy:
My, my, aren't you going to sleep?
In that case, you'll stay in a dream no matter how much time passes.

Marisa:
Hm-m, so I'm inside of a dream right now?

Doremy:
That's right. Your physical body is inside of a dream.

Marisa:
What the heck happened to the whole 'going to the Lunar Capital' thing...?

Doremy:
It seems that your dream is indeed headed to the Lunar Capital.

Doremy:
And, you are soon about to arrive.

Marisa:
Huh. That's alright then.

Doremy:
However, I cannot recommend that you remain within that nightmare.
Dreams invade your mind more than reality itself. Dreams used unnaturally are extremely dangerous.
It would be better for your mind if you kept seeing dreams about school legends, as you did before.

Marisa:
Wha...?

Doremy:
The dreams are becoming real. You must have sensed it, surely?

Doremy:
With the urban legends (Occult Balls) , that is.

Marisa:
Is this... the Lunar Capital?
Weird. There's barely anythin' alive around here.
Besides the lady from a minute ago.
Maybe I'm still in a dream or something...

Sagume:
......

Marisa:
Speak of the devil.

Sagume:
...ah, a human?
......

Marisa:
Not very friendly, are ya?
I'm a human who came here from Earth! Can't ya be a little more surprised?

Sagume:
......

Marisa:
What exactly are ya tryin' to do in Gensokyo?
Why isn't there anyone here in the Capital except you?

Sagume:
...it's still too early to speak.

Marisa:
A'ight. If you won't talk, I'll be the first to move.
That look on your face seems like you know what's up.

Sagume:
I now understand why you were sent here.
I'm sure it was on Lady Yagokoro's suggestion.
You're terribly strong. Perhaps with you...

Marisa:
So you can talk after all, huh?
Are you the one who's orderin' the attack on Gensokyo?

Sagume:
Yes, I am.
The Gensokyo Capital Relocation Plan was meant only as insurance, though.

Marisa:
Wait, relocation?

Sagume:
We're better off for not having done it, mind you.
Though it's not as if we can keep the Lunar Capital frozen like this forever...
Well, it can't really be helped.

Marisa:
I really don't get what yer talkin' about.

Sagume:
The Lunar Capital is what's really under attack.
Via a method that renders us People of the Moon unable to act, to boot.
I was considering migrating to Gensokyo to prevent us from being wiped out.

Marisa:
The Lunar Capital's under attack?

Sagume:
Yes, that is the case.
The People of the Moon aren't aware of any of this, though.
I am a being who can change the world's course with my words.
When that rumor began to spread, the Lunar Capital would materialize there, and the danger would be avoided.

Marisa:
I kinda get it, but kinda don't.
But just keep Gensokyo outta this, okay? 'S a pain.

Sagume:
You need not concern yourself.
Now that I've gone and talked about it, fate will begin to change again.
The relocation will surely not come to be.
Thus, I'll place my bet on you. There's no escape any more.
Fate has at last begun to reverse. Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!

???:
Kyahahahaha! Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies! Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic tiiiime! Welcome to a world of madness!

Marisa:
Let's review what we have so far.
The Lunar Capital's been put in stasis.
Either the lady from before or someone else did that for defense purposes...
Also, she said that there's someone else invading the Lunar Capital too.
An' they're using "a method that prevents the moon's people from acting"...
So they're using me to save the Lunar Capital, I guess?
In summary, it looks like Eirin's (she's) been takin' me for a ride since the start...

???:
You got past all the fairies bathed in my torchlight.
You must really be something.

Marisa:
Who're you?

Clownpiece:
I'm a fairy from hell, Clownpiece!
You're the first visitor we've had since honorable friend gave us this land!

Marisa:
A fairy...? Hah, can't believe those moon people would have their hands full with these guys.

Clownpiece:
Hm, you're not afraid of me?
Oh, right. Honorable friend told me something.
"If anyone comes from the Lunar Capital, do anything you want to them!"

Marisa:
Well, I get that you're the "enemy" the moon people were talkin' about.
Better beat you quickly and report this, huh?
Saving the Lunar Capital oughta save Gensokyo too, after all.

Clownpiece:
Hmmm~. Am I really not that scary?
Nah, no way. The moon's people should all be scared of my presence.
Well, it's fine by me either way. Be sullied with impurity and fall to hell!

Clownpiece:
Hah, hah, hah...
W-why...?
But I heard that as long as we fairies, symbols of life, controlled this place,
the people of the moon wouldn't be able to do a thing!

Marisa:
Well, y'see.
That's probably because I'm not from the moon.

Clownpiece:
Wait, lady... uh, I mean, madam? You're an earthling!?

Marisa:
Yup. Been squatting on the earth as long as I lived.

Clownpiece:
What's an earthling doing here...? Nobody told me this would happen.

Marisa:
By the way, I don't get why the moon's people can't do anythin' against of you fairies.

Clownpiece:
That's because the moon's people reject life and death.
Being born and dying both mean becoming impure.
As lumps of life energy, the moon's people wouldn't even think of touching us.

Marisa:
But don't all humans die?

Clownpiece:
Of course, they usually don't reject it completely,
but now our life energy has been refined thanks to the power of our honorable friend.
Wouldn't it be awful to get totally impure just by touching us? For the moon's people, I mean.

Marisa:
...I still don't totally get it,
but you at least don't seem like the true culprits behind the Lunar Capital invasion.
It's clear that someone's using you behind the scenes.
...much like m'self, really.

???:
No matter how many countermeasures I work out, you overcome them.
'Tis a shame. My nemesis was nearly within reach.

Marisa:
What are you...?
That's some power you've got. It's not magic; it's some force I've never sensed before.

???:
For not one moment did I ever expect that they would send an earthling to the moon.
And you've even reached here without even a single mistake.
For now, I shall admit defeat.

Marisa:
What do you mean?

???:
I'm surprised that the people of the moon, hating even the slightest impurity, would use such a haphazard method.
I underestimated them. It seems the battle has already been decided...

Marisa:
Don't really get what you mean, but it's great that I've won!
Yep. Real great.
--okay, you're pissin' me off somehow! What exactly are you?

Junko:
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.

Marisa:
Not sure why, but I guess the rule was that you lose once I get here, huh?

Junko:
That's true. However...
Since you've managed to come here, I humbly challenge you to a duel.
It is only polite, is it not?

Marisa:
Augh, dammit!
You sayin' I was nothin' but Eirin's pawn since the start!? Fer' god's sakes!
I've got nowhere to vent this anger. I'll just hafta take it all out on you!

Junko:
Yes, anger is the only force driving me as well.
Even if we are unable to dwell together under Heaven, my hatred alone will be refined.
Now, show me! Just what an earthling risking her life is capable of!
And behold! This pristine spiritual force that rejects life and death!

???:
No matter how many countermeasures I work out, you overcome them.
However, it seems your foolish scheme has ended in failure.

Marisa:
What are you...?
That's some power you've got. It's not magic; it's some force I've never sensed before.

???:
Indeed. It is a pristine force, one that the likes of you humans would never have.

Marisa:
Aha, sounds real interesting. I'll have you show me that power!

???:
The people of the moon escape into a dream, and send an earthling to deal with me.
I thought it to be a daring plan, but I suppose I overestimated them.

Marisa:
What'd you say?

???:
A human so completely surrounded by the stench of death can never hope to defeat me.

Junko:
My name is Junko.
With my power of purification, I am able to kill you unconditionally.
Just how many mistakes have you made before reaching here?

Marisa:
I didn't make no mistakes!

Junko:
Allow me to count that petty lie as one mistake as well.

Marisa:
Yeah, okay, that was a lie.
The enemies this time are way too strong, anyway! Of course I'd make a couple mistakes here an' there!

Junko:
The moon's people, too, have committed a foolish mistake.
It seems this earthling is far more weak than you all thought.
My stagnated engagement with the people of the moon was just beginning to exhaust my interest.
My mortal enemy, Chang'e. Are you watching!? Look at the numerous lives and deaths, the impurities, this poor soul brings!

Sanae:
I'm sure I've seen that probe-looking thing around here.

???:
Commencing immediate attack!

Seiran:
This is Seiran. I've made contact with a belligerent earthling.
Now proceeding with purification.

Sanae:
Hm-m? Those ears... Are you a rabbit?

Seiran:
We are Eagle Ravi, the investigation corps of the Moon rabbits.

Seiran:
Hindrances are to be eliminated!

Seiran:
Man, why aren't any reinforcements coming?
That's why they say that rabbits nowadays are disobedient garbage„Éº

Sanae:
By the way, did you see a probe... um, a mechanical spider-looking thing around here?

Seiran:
I guess you're talking about the Earth probes. They're returning to the base for now„Éº
Wait, I'm not supposed to tell you this! It's a secret to everyone!

Sanae:
I see, I see. So, if you're already at it, could you please tell me where that base is?

Sanae:
To think that their base is so close to our house... what a blind spot.

???:
I've been waiting for you„Éº

Ringo:
I heard about you from Seiran. She said she'd engaged an interesting person...

Sanae:
I'll have you know that this lake is under our control.
Please don't behave as you please around here, okay?

Ringo:
Do you even know who we are?

Ringo:
We are Eagle Ravi, the investigation corps of the Moon rabbits.
We will not receive any orders from impure earthlings.

Ringo:
Oh, not bad at all. You're pretty strong.

Sanae:
Moon rabbits...
Are you friends of the people at Eientei?

Ringo:
We are military rabbits on duty. Unfortunately, they are our enemies.

Sanae:
Mmm... So, that means...
that you're my enemies too?

Ringo:
You're not an enemy. But not even an ally, either.
The earthlings have done a surprisingly good job helping in the process of purification.
...well, apparently. Although it's hard to understand for us underling rabbits.

Sanae:
Hard to understand, you say...

Ringo:
So, what are you going to do?
If you want to, you can go forward from here.

Ringo:
I like the Earth (this place) , though, so I'll stay here.

Sanae:
Ah, I'm flying through space! I'm really flying right now!

???:
Oh, my.

Doremy:
It seems you're having quite the nightmare. I'll just help myself to it... wait.

Doremy:
Is that your physical body!? You're having a nightmare in the flesh!?

Sanae:
I'm flying through space like I've always wanted. If this is a nightmare, what would even count as a good dream?

Doremy:
If your body is hit by nightmare fragments (space debris) , it won't be pleasant.
I ought to send you back to reality right away. Even just your body, at least.

Sanae:
Uh, so, I don't really understand what's going on, but a rabbit told me that this is the way to the Lunar Capital.

Doremy:
The Lunar Capital... Oh-ho, I see now.

Doremy:
Very well. I will dispose of this lunatic dream.

Doremy:
Now, sleep. I will craft your Kaian now.

Doremy:
I have helped myself to your delicious nightmares.
However, if you still intend on going to the Lunar Capital,
your mind will surely be eroded by a nightmare many times greater than before.
It is worthy of being called a 'lunatic dream'.
Right now, you can still "wake up and find out that it was only a dream"...
Will you still proceed, despite that?

Sanae:
I know this question. And I know the answer to it.
You'll just keep saying 'but thou must!' no matter how many times I say no, right?
So the answer is "yes"! I am going to the Lunar Capital!

Doremy:
I see... In that case, I wish you good dreams.

Sanae:
Ever since Apollo 17 landed on the Moon, there hasn't been a manned expedition for over 40 years.
With a chance like this right in front of me, there's no way I'll let it end with "it was all just a dream"!

Sanae:
So there's an advanced civilization on the moon; NASA knows about it, but is concealing it.
I remember hearing an urban legend like that once.
Seeing this, I guess I can't say it was entirely an urban legend in the end, huh...?

Sagume:
......

Sanae:
Are you one of the moon's people?

Sagume:
...

Sanae:
Excuuuse me...
Helloooo...?

Sagume:
...

Sanae:
(Maybe her hearing's bad.)

Sagume:
...That's not it.

Sanae:
Aah, that gave me a fright.

Sagume:
I was just trying to think of a reason why a human would be on the moon.

Sanae:
So you are a lunar citizen...
I've actually got a lot of questions for you.

Sagume:
...

Sanae:
(Could it be you're ignoring me?)

Sagume:
...That's not it.
Nothing is settled yet, so there's no way I'll say anything!

Sanae:
Just attacking someone out of the blue like that is really rude, you know!

Sagume:
I'm sorry that I had to test you like that.
I've decided now.
Let's talk about everything.

Sanae:
Haah... So, what are you trying to do in Gensokyo?

Sagume:
As you can see, the Lunar Capital is frozen right now.
This is a defense against a certain enemy's invasion,
but as she controls the source of life, we're unable to act against her plans.
Because we people of the moon reject life and death, you see...

Sanae:
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Sagume:
We can't just leave things frozen like this either,
so just as insurance, I created the Gensokyo Capital Relocation Plan.

Sanae:
Relocation? Er, what's that?

Sagume:
Moving. Although we're better off for not having done it.

Sanae:
Ahh, I see. The Lunar Capital has it tough, too.
Well, Gensokyo's a nice place, so maybe it'd be okay if you moved there.

Sagume:
Is that so...? Perhaps I miscalculated a little.
I would have thought that you were acting at Lady Yagokoro's suggestion.

Sanae:
Ah, well, uh...

Sagume:
But it's too late for that.
I am Sagume, a being who can change the world's course with my words.
Now that I've gone and talked about it, fate will begin to change again.
The relocation will surely not come to be.
I have no choice but to bet the fate of the Lunar Capital on you. There's no escape any more.
Fate has at last begun to reverse. Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!

???:
Kyahahahaha! Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies! Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic tiiiime! Welcome to world of madness!

Sanae:
I think just going with the flow has left me in an unbelievable situation...!
Well, putting that aside, to summarize that conversation just now...
"You're the only one who can save the Lunar Capital!"
That's about right, isn't it?
I guess this means everyone's relying on me, huh?

???:
You got past all the fairies bathed in my torchlight.
You must really be something!

Sanae:
I won't lose! Saving the Lunar Capital is my destiny!

???:
Oho, is that right?

Clownpiece:
I'm a fairy from hell, Clownpiece.
The moon's people are enemies of honorable friend. Enemies of honorable friend are enemies of Master's.
And any enemy of Master's is an enemy of mine! I'll show no mercy.

Sanae:
Uh, no, I'm not from the...

Clownpiece:
Tooooo late.
I was told I could do whatever I want to anyone who came from the Lunar Capital.

Clownpiece:
Y'see, the light from my torch drives anyone it touches crazy.
And going crazy means bringing out your true strength.
I'm gonna beat you down with this tremendous power!

Clownpiece:
Hah, hah, hah...
W-why...?
But I heard that as long as we fairies, symbols of life, controlled this place,
the people of the moon wouldn't be able to do a thing.

Sanae:
I told you, I'm not from the...

Clownpiece:
Wait, lady... er, madam...? Could you be an earthling!?

Sanae:
Yes! I am a citizen of Earth.

Clownpiece:
What's an earthling doing here...? Nobody told me this would happen„Éº

Sanae:
Yeah... It's all a bit strange for me, too.
This looks like the surface of the moon, but...
what about the atmosphere and all?
How are our voices being carried?

Clownpiece:
Mmm... I don't really know what you're talking about.

Sanae:
Is this really what the moon is like, or am I still in a dream?
Or, maybe the fairies being here has some kind of effect...?
Ah, that's right. Fairies are incarnations of nature, so...
...the atmosphere exists because of the fairies?

Clownpiece:
So what were you here for, again?

Sanae:
I'm here to save the Lunar Capital on orders from that ‚ÄòSagume‚Äô person!

Clownpiece:
Well, I was told that the people of the moon are my enemy, but I dunno about earthlings...
I don't really know what's going on anymore, but I've had enough of all this.
I'm tired. Can I leave yet?

Sanae:
(If the fairies are creating the atmosphere,) (then I'm alive because of the fairies...)
You can't sleep! If you sleep, someone's gonna die! (Me.)

Clownpiece:
I'll take you to where our honorable friend is, so just spare me already„Éº

???:
No matter how many countermeasures I work out, you overcome them.
'Tis a shame. My nemesis was nearly within reach.

Sanae:
So you're the one invading the Lunar Capital! Come, let us do battle fair and square!

???:
...You have not a single blemish.
I admit defeat.

Sanae:
Hwha-wha-whaaa?

???:
For not one moment did I ever expect that they would send an earthling to the moon.
I underestimated them. It seems the battle has already been decided...

Sanae:
Wuh... buh... huh...
Hey! What's that supposed to mean! Who even are you, anyway!?

Junko:
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.
Now, shall we begin our clean-up battle?

Sanae:
Just what is this pent-up frustration I'm feeling?
What do you mean, I've already won?

Junko:
For an uninjured human to arrive at this point, my current plan must already have failed.

Sanae:
Somehow, I can't agree with that...

Junko:
I have underestimated humans.
After all, even the crew of Apollo 11 was covered with wounds, they say.

Sanae:
Huh? Details, please.

Junko:
Putting that aside, you will triumph over me.
That is the scenario that has been constructed by another's hand.

Junko:
However, that victory will surely be accompanied by a nightmare.
Even if we are unable to dwell together under Heaven, my hatred alone will be refined.
That this hatred will never touch her leaves nothing for me but vexation!
In exchange, I'll vent myself against you, such that your victory, the outcome of this cruel fate, may be realized!

???:
No matter how many countermeasures I work out, you overcome them.
However, it seems your foolish scheme has ended in failure.

Sanae:
So you're the one invading the Lunar Capital! Come, let us do battle!

???:
Yes, to think that you could do battle with me was absurd.
The people of the moon escape into a dream, and send an earthling to deal with me.
I thought it to be a daring plan, but I suppose I overestimated them.

Sanae:
What's that supposed to mean?

Junko:
A human so completely surrounded by the stench of death can never hope to defeat me.

Junko:
My name is Junko.
With my power of purification, I am able to kill you unconditionally.
Just how many mistakes have you suffered on the way here?

Sanae:
By 'mistakes', you mean getting shot?
Well, about, uh...

Junko:
An uncountable number, I'm sure.

Sanae:
Well, yeah. A couple shots here and there are fine, aren't they? I'm only human, after all.

Junko:
The moon's people, too, have committed a foolish mistake.
It seems this earthling is far more weak than you all thought.
My stagnated engagement with the people of the moon was just beginning to exhaust my interest.
My mortal enemy, Chang'e. Are you watching!? Gaze upon the lunar citizens' foolish plan, and upon this impure human!

Reisen:
So the time has finally come.

???:
Oh, my.

Seiran:
It's been a while! Have you been doing well?

Reisen:
Aside from you attacking me pretty flashily, yes.

Seiran:
Well, it's for work. You know how it is, right?

Seiran:
So just behave yourself and get beaten here, okay?

Seiran:
Huh? Why did you beat me?

Reisen:
Sorry, but I've become an earth rabbit.
Basically, you're my enemy... No, not you. The ones above you.

Seiran:
Mayday, mayday! This is a state of emergency!

Reisen:
That's right, spread the word to everyone with telepathy.
To all those selfish moon rabbits.

Reisen:
Mmm, the wind up here brings back memories.

???:
So is it true that you betrayed us?

Ringo:
Fighting your fellow moon rabbits, honestly.

Reisen:
Well, I suppose. I'm acting under orders too, though.

Ringo:
You've got it tough, too, huh? Even on Earth, it's work, work, work.
And us rabbits' working conditions haven't improved at all, either...

Reisen:
Anyway, my mission requires me to infiltrate the capital.
So would you mind letting me use the passage?

Ringo:
Do you think I'm just going to say 'Yes, go right ahead'?
'Eliminate traitors' is written in our work regulations, too.

Reisen:
Earth's environment is harsh, but there's never a dull moment, so it's pretty fun.
Well, your home capital is what you make it, right?

Ringo:
Yeah, I want to live on Earth too...
And just forget about work and everything else.

Reisen:
Now, then, it's been a while, but it's time for me to infiltrate the Lunar Capital.

Ringo:
Ah, right, let me give you one warning.
Right now, the Lunar Capital has started going crazy thanks to a single lunatic.
Understand that there's nothing left of the pure land of old.

Reisen:
Oho...

Reisen:
This is Kaian Passageway #4, I believe? ...It's been a while, so I've started to forget.

???:
Ah, that's far enough.

Doremy:
I've been told to not let you through here.
I have no grudge against you, but I've got a job to do too.

Reisen:
A... a baku? This is ridiculous...
What's the most dangerous youkai in the Dream World (this place) doing here in front of me?

Doremy:
I'm a little caught up in these events, too. This much work is more of a matter of duty.
Now be a good girl, have a nice, long sleep, and forget about everything.

Reisen:
Putting an enemy in a passageway that only rabbits use...
It's obvious they're trying to lure me, or somebody, in...

Doremy:
As you know, the passageway between Earth and the Lunar Capital is the mental world.
This is the Dream World! Don't think you can stand against me, an eater and creator of dreams!

Reisen:
Even if there's a nightmare waiting for me ahead, I have no choice but to go on.
It's my job, after all. I've got to do it.

Doremy:
I see...
I may just be here for form's sake, but I've done my job, so that's enough.
That aside, you're rather unusual for a rabbit.
Actually doing your job properly... Perhaps you've got a sense of duty?

Reisen:
Well... maybe I'm still a little crazy.
Even though this impure world ought to have calmed the moon's madness down...

Doremy:
No, this isn't the moon's madness. What I feel from you is...
...if I had to say, I'd call it earthliness...
Like those humans, who manage to come up with their own individuality by embracing the dreams that others prepared for them.
In short, you've been tainted. By this impure land.
Your impure self will see nothing but lunacy in the Lunar Capital now.
Be even more careful than you need to. Now, then, I wish you pleasant dreams.

Reisen:
What is this!?
Why's everything frozen over like this?
And nobody's here...

Reisen:
Ah, Lady Sagume... What's going on here?

Sagume:
...a rabbit?
But the people of the moon should have all been evacuated to the fake Lunar Capital by now.

Reisen:
Fake... Lunar Capital?
Does that mean everyone's in the dream world or something?

Sagume:
Good guess.
The people of the moon have all mistaken the dream world for the real capital.
That is the Lunar Capital's lunatic dream.

Reisen:
For you to be be so unusually talkative, Lady Sagume,
something really strange must be happening after all.

Sagume:
You're the rabbit that fell to Earth, aren't you? The one from Lady Yagokoro's place.

Sagume:
I never thought the baku would let you pass through to this place, but...
...perhaps that possibility does exist...?
I'll now test the power of you who fell to Earth!

Sagume:
I see, I see. That's enough.
I understand the reason that Lady Yagokoro dispatched you for this.
You might be able to save the Lunar Capital.

Reisen:
Whaaaat? Save the Lunar Capital„Éº?

Sagume:
Right now, an enemy of the Lunar Capital is trying to invade.

Reisen:
Invade?

Sagume:
And she's using the power of life, which we people of the moon can't act against.
We panicked, put the Lunar Capital in stasis, and evacuated everyone,
but that lunatic dream can't sustain the citizens' minds forever like this.
So we thought we would relocate to Gensokyo soon.

Reisen:
Hwa!? Relocate!?
Ahh, that's just too big a shock. So the moon rabbits that came to Earth...

Sagume:
They have no idea, of course.
All we told them was that the Lunar Capital was building a summer home on Earth.

Reisen:
...I really can't stand the way the lunar authorities always hide things just for the sake of hiding them.
But why are you telling me this?

Sagume:
I'm telling you because you fulfill the conditions necessary to strike back at our enemy.
Our enemy has the power to control the source of life.
She's crafty, turning our own rejection of life and death against us...
...but you no longer reject it. Your body and soul have both fallen to Earth.
Because of your impurity, you can travel to where she is.

Reisen:
Phew, that's quite a story. Thank you.
Lady Eirin and Lady Kaguya knew all this from the beginning, so they sent me and those humans.
They really don't mind putting people in danger.

Sagume:
Because I told you about the plan, we won't be able to relocate to Gensokyo anymore.
So we have nothing left but to rely on you. Do you understand?

Reisen:
Aah, if that's what you say, Lady Sagume, that's just how it'll be.
By hook or by crook.

Sagume:
If you get it, then go already! Now, on to the enemy's home base, the Sea of Tranquility!
Consider that an imperial order. From the part of me that's a heavenly god...

???:
Kyahahahaha! Something real interesting is going on~!
Hey, fairies! Let's crank up the speed!
It's lunatic time! Welcome to a world of madness!

Reisen:
A swarm of fairies outside the capital...?
Are these the invaders Lady Sagume mentioned?
Well, it's true that fairies are a symbol of impurity, but I don't think they have the intelligence to invade.
And the people of the moon shouldn't fear the level of impurity from mere fairies...
...Wait, that's not the problem here.
What are fairies doing on the moon in the first place? That's the real question.

???:
Well, you see...
There's a few here who were brought from Earth,
but there were originally fairies living on the moon, too!

Reisen:
So you're the fairies' boss.
You do seem a bit different from the other fairies, but...
I can hardly believe that the moon's people would have their hands full with you...!

???:
Who do you think I am?

Clownpiece:
I'm a fairy from hell, Clownpiece.
The moon's people are enemies of honorable friend. Enemies of honorable friend are enemies of Master's.
And any enemy of Master's is an enemy of mine! I'll show no mercy.

Reisen:
I'm not really sure I get the whole picture here... but you won't get any mercy from me, either!

Clownpiece:
They say that a refined fairy's energy exceeds even that of a kishin.
Taste the impurity of life and death that the moon's people hate so much,
and let your first death send you falling into hell!

Clownpiece:
Hah, hah, hah...

Reisen:
This overwhelming power... You aren't an ordinary fairy, are you!?

Clownpiece:
W-why...?
But I heard that as long as we fairies, symbols of life, controlled this place,
the people of the moon wouldn't be able to do a thing.

Reisen:
Hey, who exactly did you hear that from?

Clownpiece:
My honorable friend.
The one who refined us fairies' power was her, too.

Reisen:
Refined? What does that mean...?

Clownpiece:
I don't really get it either, but apparently it's something really amazing.

Reisen:
Hmm. So she tricked the fairies and did something to them?
The fairies around here are really impure, after all.
No, at this level you could say they basically are impurity.
Being attacked with something at this level might really send the capital into ruin after all...

Clownpiece:
Hey, lady... er, madam... why are you okay with all of my impurity?

Reisen:
Because I'm... an earth rabbit, now.
Once you've become impure once, it's impossible to return.
But this confirms it.
My master sent me to save the Lunar Capital.
But the enemy understood the lunar citizens' weak point, and had the ability to make use of that knowledge.
What sort of person could they be...?
Master and Lady Sagume probably both know, but they won't tell me...
Either way, since I've come this far, I'll just have to live up to Master's expectations!

???:
They say that violence comes after all other means have been exhausted, do they not?
I never hoped to see the moon's people come to this.

Reisen:
...Who are you?

Junko:
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.

Reisen:
I've never heard of the people of the moon having an enemy like you!

Junko:
To think they sent a moon rabbit (soldier) after me.
Perhaps the citizens of lunacy have descended into sanity.

Reisen:
Who knows. I'm just here to do my job, so I wouldn't really know about lunacy or sanity.
But I can say this!
The people of the moon will remain in lunacy! Unwavering lunacy, absolute lunacy!
If they didn't, there's no way they'd pass this job on me.

Junko:
Hoh... if you'll go that far, then perhaps you have a secret of your own?
A secret plan of the moon that I've had yet to recognize.

Reisen:
Who knows.
But the one who needs to watch out is you.
I've come here on Lady Sagume's orders.
This fate has already begun to be reversed!

Junko:
Interesting... so the people of the moon do not abhor me. In that case, come at me.
What can a moon rabbit do? What are the people of the moon thinking?
Now, show me! The ruined remains of the impure people of the moon!
And behold! Just what lies beyond this pristine impurity!

Junko:
They say that violence comes after all other means have been exhausted, do they not?
I never hoped to see the moon's people come to this.

Reisen:
...Who are you?

Junko:
My name is Junko.
A sagacious spirit bearing ill will to the citizens of the moon.

Reisen:
I've never heard of the people of the moon having an enemy like you!

Junko:
To think they sent a moon rabbit (soldier) after me... hmm?
What is this? Why have you become so impure?
And why have you accepted all these mistakes?

Reisen:
Um, it's not like I really accepted them, but...
I've stopped being a moon rabbit. I'm an earth rabbit now.

Junko:
W-what? Such a scheme from the people of the moon...
Dropping a moon rabbit to Earth in order to strike at me...
I'm genuinely impressed!

Reisen:
Wha? Ah, really?

Junko:
But schemes are just schemes. The people of the moon have made a foolish mistake, as well.
This earth rabbit bears impurity beyond what is necessary.
Like this, she is powerless against my strength! Absolutely powerless!
Now, my mortal enemy, Chang'e. Are you watching?
I'm going to torment this girl until you come out!

Doremy:
So you've come here again, hm...
Have you prepared yourself?
Your lunatic dream isn't over yet. Know a reality that will follow you forever!

Junko:
It took longer than I anticipated for them arrive at this answer.
Since they came up with the scheme to use a human, I thought they'd realize it right away...

Reimu:
Bah, it's you again!
I knew this had to be your doing!

Junko:
The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself! Hecatia, goddess of hell!

Hecatia:
Aw, geeze. You totally kept me waiting, y'know.

Reimu:
G-goddess? You?

Hecatia:
So we're finally gonna get revenge on Chang'e, huh? My fingers are so itching„Éº

Junko:
Ah, no. Your enemy is the human before you, not the moon's people.

Hecatia:
Human? For real? Like, they're physically here?
Hmm... Let's have a look-see.

Reimu:
I don't quite get it, but the moon's people can't return to the capital...
...because of you, right?
If they sit around in the dream world, it's a big problem for us humans too!

Hecatia:
'Kay, all confirmed. Sure thing, sure thing! I'll take you on.
You sure found some good material, Junko.

Junko:
Well, it was the moon's people who found her...
But thanks to them, my once-dismal life on Earth may get a lot more fun.

Hecatia:
So what are we going with? Two on one? Or should I call in my other two selves and make it four on one?

Junko:
No... that would be quite a waste indeed. Let's do this fairly and battle in turns.

Hecatia:
Totally with you on the 'waste' part. To~tally. See, we're a totally good match.

Reimu:
How long are you gonna keep me waiting!? I'm always prepared for battle!

Hecatia:
Whoops, sorry. I did keep you waiting, yeah.
I'll answer your question from before.
Yes, I'm the one keeping the moon's people tied down in the dream world.
They're totally defenseless while they're in here. It was easy.

Reimu:
Let the people of the moon go this instant!
If you don't, I'll grind you into the dust right here!

Hecatia:
All right. You're a cute little thing, so I'll play with you a bit.
Usually, I'd rather not fight the likes of a human, but...
"You used some rude language towards me." For that reason alone, I'll drop you into hell.
For that reason, and no more! Now, suffer even in death!

Reimu:
Hey, you both attacked at the end! That's no fair!

Hecatia:
Sorry, sorry. I was just playing around a bit. I lost the battle.
Honestly, attacking Gensokyo? When there's such amazing humans there?
I've got no idea what the moon's people were thinking.

Reimu:
Let the people of the moon go. Now.

Hecatia:
Hey, Junko. Is this okay?

Junko:
...it's fine. Even if they return to the capital...
Thanks to my encounter with this human, I've lost my will to fight.

Hecatia:
Sure thing, sure thing. Releasing the moon's people now.
They ought to pull out of Gensokyo now, too.

Reimu:
...y'know, I'm still not satisfied with ending up saving the moon's people...

Hecatia:
Well, about that...

Junko:
The people of the moon truly are cunning and cruel.

Reimu:
Hm?

Junko:
You can think of it as them taking Gensokyo hostage, no?
"If you want Gensokyo to be spared, leave the moon." A terribly inhumane strategy.

Reimu:
Huh, guess so.
When I think about it like that, I get somehow annoyed.
Next time I meet Eirin's lot, I'm gonna have to punch them.

Junko:
Eirin? Is that the name of the lunar sage living on Earth?

Reimu:
Er, um, uhhhhh,

Junko:
Could you perhaps guide me to her place of residence?

Reimu:
Uh, um. Is that okay? Having you meet her?

Junko:
I don't particularly intend to fight her. For now.

Hecatia:
Sounds good! Take me along, too!
It's thanks to this sage that I met a human like you, after all.

Reimu:
Well, all right. But you'd better remember this, okay?
If you cause any sort of problem in Gensokyo, I'll exterminate you at once!

Hecatia:
Yes, yes.

Doremy:
So you've come here again, hm...
I told you, didn't I?
Dreams invade your mind more than reality. Your lunatic dream isn't over yet!

Junko:
It took longer than I anticipated for them arrive at this answer.
Since they came up with the scheme to use a human, I thought they'd realize it right away...

Marisa:
Huh, so it was you after all.
Those moon people still haven't pulled out of Gensokyo.
What are you up to this time?

Junko:
The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself! Hecatia, goddess of hell!

Hecatia:
Aw, geeze. You totally kept me waiting, y'know.

Marisa:
Wait, what? You're not alone?

Hecatia:
So we're finally gonna get revenge on Chang'e, huh? My fingers are so itching„Éº

Junko:
Ah, no. Your enemy is the human before you, not the moon's people.

Hecatia:
Human? For real? Like, they're physically here?
Hmm... Let's have a look-see.

Marisa:
W-what's with you? Quit starin' at me.

Hecatia:
Well, all right. So this human's been giving you a hard time, Junko?

Junko:
It wasn't merely a 'hard time'.
It's thanks to this human that we were defeated, albeit only halfway.

Hecatia:
Whaaaat? She's that strong...?

Junko:
The moon's people were quite cunning, sending this human to fight me.

Hecatia:
Hmm, interesting. If you're saying that much, they must be the real thing.

Marisa:
Well, I dunno what's happenin', but I'm definitely real!
If you keep the moon people trapped in the dream world, it'll be real bad for Gensokyo!
That's definitely your doing! So I'm gonna take you down!

Hecatia:
Yes, I'm the one keeping the moon's people tied down in the dream world.
They're totally defenseless while they're in here. It was easy.

Hecatia:
Okay, my mind's made up!
Usually, I'd rather not fight the likes of a human, but...
"You fought back against my friend." For that reason alone, I'll drop you into hell.
For that reason, and no more! Now, suffer even in death!

Marisa:
Hey, you both attacked! That's playin' dirty!

Hecatia:
Hahaha, I was just playing around a bit. I lost the battle.
You're as amazing a human as Junko said.
Honestly, attacking Gensokyo? When there's such amazing humans there?
I'm finding it kinda hard to forgive the moon's people.

Marisa:
Well, I hafta agree... But for now, I'd like ya to let them go.
If you don't, it'll be dangerous fer' Gensokyo.

Hecatia:
Hey, Junko? Is this okay?

Junko:
...it's fine. Even if they return to the capital...
Thanks to my encounter with this human, I've lost my will to fight.

Hecatia:
Sure thing, sure thing. Releasing the moon's people now.
They ought to pull out of Gensokyo now, too.

Marisa:
That aside, what are you guys anyway?
If you're enemies of the moon's people, we might have a common interest, here...

Junko:
Our enemy is Chang'e, the leader of the moon rabbits.
She is the wife of the man who stole my son's life away.

Hecatia:
And the wife of the guy who killed one of my stars.

Marisa:
Huh. So it's dictionary-definition revenge, then?
(Don't quite get that 'killed a star' thing,) (but maybe I shouldn't pry.)
But, eh, sorry 'bout all this.
Now you gotta give up on your revenge for our sake, an' all.

Junko:
It's all right. We have endless opportunities.
Yes, this revenge drama will repeat itself for all eternity.

Marisa:
A'ight then.
You get the moon involved, an' just about everything takes forever.

Hecatia:
Hey, is it okay if I come over to your place to play next time?
With even a human this powerful, I'd practically never get bored.

Marisa:
Uh, aren't you a hell goddess? Really don't like idea of you raisin' hell over there.

Hecatia:
Nah, it's fine. As long as I'm on Earth, I'm an Earth goddess.

Marisa:
That so...?

Doremy:
So you've come here again, hm...
I told you, didn't I?
If you had made it all just a dream back then, 
you wouldn't be seeing such a lunatic dream now...

Junko:
It took longer than I anticipated for them arrive at this answer.
Since they came up with the scheme to use a human, I thought they'd realize it right away...

Sanae:
So we meet again!
This time, I shall certainly defeat you!

Junko:
...The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself! Hecatia, goddess of hell!

Hecatia:
Aw, geeze. You totally kept me waiting, y'know.
So we're finally gonna get revenge on Chang'e, huh? My fingers are so itching„Éº

Junko:
Ah, no. Your enemy is the human before you, not the moon's people.

Hecatia:
Human? For real? Like, they're physically here?
Hmm... Let's have a look-see.

Sanae:
Mmm. Two enemies, huh?

Hecatia:
Oh, does it look like two? Heh heh heh.
Well, all right. So this human's been giving you a hard time, Junko?

Junko:
It wasn't merely a 'hard time'.
It's thanks to this human that we were defeated, albeit only halfway.

Hecatia:
Whaaaat? She's that strong...?

Junko:
The moon's people were quite cunning, sending this human to fight me.

Hecatia:
Hmm, interesting. If you're saying that much, they must be the real thing.

Sanae:
This sure is a dangerous atmosphere...
Maybe I ought to retreat for now and call in some allies.

Hecatia:
Aw, c'mooon. You don't have to be that scared of me, you know?
I'm not going to fight you seriously.
It kinda seems like Junko's prepared for defeat, anyway...
It doesn't really matter who wins or loses any more.
So we're gonna fight you one at a time, nice and fair! This is just a bit of entertainment.

Sanae:
Oh, really? That's a relief.
In that case... Do battle with me at once! You freaky T-shirt weirdo!

Hecatia:
All right. You're a cute little thing, so I'll play with you a bit.
Usually, I'd rather not fight the likes of a human, but...
"You totally insulted me just now." For that reason alone, I'll drop you into hell.
For that reason, and no more! Now, suffer even in death!

Sanae:
Hey, you broke your promise! You both attacked at the end!

Hecatia:
Oh, hey, sorry about that. The battle's over already. I lost.
You're as amazing a human as Junko said.
Honestly, attacking Gensokyo? When there's such amazing humans there?
I'm finding it kinda hard to forgive the moon's people.

Sanae:
Just the same, I'd like you to release those hard-to-forgive people now.

Hecatia:
Hey, Junko? Is this okay?

Junko:
...it's fine. Even if they return to the capital...
Thanks to my encounter with this human, I've lost my will to fight.

Hecatia:
Sure thing, sure thing. Releasing the moon's people now.
They ought to pull out of Gensokyo now, too.

Sanae:
Really?
You already tricked me once before, so I don't know if I can trust you.

Junko:
We have no intent to deceive.
I never thought that the moon's people would take all of Gensokyo hostage.
My plan only indirectly resulted in Gensokyo being attacked.
The people of the moon are our only enemies.

Sanae:
Well... okay.
Oh, now that you mention it. There's some moon people living in Gensokyo.

Hecatia:
Yeah, them.
What about them?

Sanae:
How about you went and protested to them a little?
As delegates of the moon's people.

Junko:
Oh, that could work.

Sanae:
But just by speaking, of course? Violence isn't a good thing!

Hecatia:
Mmm, but what if they use violence against us first?

Sanae:
Then fight them as you please! Just like us a minute ago!

Hecatia:
Ahahaha~. You're funny„Éº

Junko:
Heh heh heh. For now, I have no desire for revenge.
It seems it'll be a long time until my next revenge drama.
Thanks to you.

Hecatia:
We~ell, seems like it's about time for us to head back, huh?

Sanae:
Head back? Where to?

Hecatia:
Back to Earth. We're not people of the moon, after all.

Doremy:
So you've come here again, hm...
There's no turning back now.
The lunacy of the moon's people is nothing but poison to you by now!

Junko:
It took longer than I anticipated for them arrive at this answer.
Since they came up with the scheme to drop a moon rabbit to Earth,
I thought they'd realize it right away...

Reisen:
I heard about why you hate the people of the moon.
Look, I can sympathize with your situation...
But the majority of the moon's people have nothing to do with all that!
Didn't we settle this in our last battle?
Why are the moon's people still in here!?

Junko:
...The people of the moon escaped into the dream world.
I foresaw that they would do so, as they were unable to stay in the Lunar Capital.
Of course, I took the initiative.
I sent an assassin into the dream world first.
Now, show yourself! Hecatia, goddess of hell!

Hecatia:
Aw, geeze. You totally kept me waiting, y'know.
So we're finally gonna get revenge on Chang'e, huh? My fingers are so itching„Éº

Junko:
Ah, no. Your enemy is the rabbit before you, not the moon's people.

Hecatia:
Rabbit? You mean a moon rabbit? One of Chang'e's minions?
Sure can't let her escape, in that case.

Reisen:
W-who are you?

Hecatia:
I'm the goddess of hell, wielding three bodies for the moon, the Earth, and the Otherworld.
I set a trap in the dream world as part of Junko's plan.

Reisen:
I see. You're the 'Master' who that fairy on the moon mentioned.
That weird outfit of yours says it all.

Hecatia:
But hey, Junko? Why'd you bring me out for one little moon rabbit?

Junko:
She's no ordinary rabbit. She was the trump card of the moon's people.
It's thanks to this rabbit that we were defeated, albeit only halfway.

Hecatia:
Whaaaat? How'd she do that...?
I can't believe a single rabbit could ruin our whole plan.
Welp, nothing else to do. Gotta get rid of her.

Reisen:
So it's come to this after all.
I'm not even a moon rabbit any more, though...

Hecatia:
Moon rabbits are minions of Chang'e, my long-standing rival.
There's no way I can let this rabbit return alive.
I'll give you a real fun choice!
The moon, the Earth, or the Otherworld...? Pick whichever body you want to be killed by!

Reisen:
Two at once? Aren't you shamed to hold bare-knuckles?

Hecatia:
Nah, see, it was just a little joke. I lost the battle.
...now, you. I caught on partway through, but...
You're not a moon rabbit, are you?

Reisen:
No, I'm not. I became a rabbit of Gensokyo!
I can't return to being a moon rabbit now.

Hecatia:
You're pretty interesting.
I see, I see~. So this was a strategy from the lunar sage on Earth...
Hey, I'd kind of like to meet that sage~.

Reisen:
...I also came here to extend an invitation to you two.
However, as a condition, you'll have to release the citizens in the dream world...
And promise never to attack the Lunar Capital again.

Hecatia:
Hey, Junko. Is this okay?

Junko:
...it's fine. Even if they return to the capital.
However, I can only accede to one of those conditions.
If, instead of "never attack again," you make it "don't attack for a while," I'll accept.

Reisen:
...I understand. That'll be fine.

Hecatia:
Okay, okay. Releasing the moon's people now.

Reisen:
(There, just like Lady Eirin said. They'll want to meet us anyway, so give them some conditions.)
(But they'll want to change one of the conditions, so just accept those new terms.)
These two might be such a good match with Lady Eirin and company that they can read each others' minds.

Hecatia:
Hm? Did you say something?

Reisen:
Whoops, said that out loud. Nothing, it was nothing.

Junko:
You needn't worry.
For now, I have no desire for revenge.
In the first place, the people of the moon living in Gensokyo are by no means my enemy.
That extends to you too.
Also...

Hecatia:
Oh, that's great.

Reisen:
What is?

Hecatia:
It sounds like Junko's taken a bit of an interest in you.
It's thanks to you that she'll put a hold on her revenge for a while.

Reisen:
O-oh, is that so. I'm quite honored...

Hecatia:
I mean, if you're not a moon rabbit, she's got no reason to hate you.
Maybe I'll search for some interesting people in Gensokyo, too...?
If you've got anyone in mind, feel free to introduce me!

Reimu:
Let's see. What should we start looking at first?

Kasen:
To know our enemy who spread this rumor, first, we must know the inside out of this incident they caused.
To be specific, we're going to use Perfect Possession on ourselves to fight.

Reimu:
There's no better things to do when we have no clues anyway.
But I'm sure we can start with...

Marisa:
Hey! Wanna do a quick match to kill some time?

Reimu:
You're right on time.
The perfect first subject for the Perfect Possession investigation!

Marisa:
Subject? What's that about?

Kasen:
Sorry, but today it's gonna be a two versus one.

Marisa:
Whoa, did you two just swap? That's Perfect Possession, right?

Reimu:
Yep. We're finding the truth behind it by actually using it!

Kasen:
Wait a second, Marisa, you've already...

Koishi:
Um, hello? Where am I?

Reimu:
You've been under Perfect Possession all along!

Marisa:
How did I get perfect possessed?

Marisa:
Hey, what exactly is this? I feel like I just swapped to another person.

Reimu:
You didn't notice anything that happened to you, huh.
The interchange of both body and mind. That's what we called "Perfect Possession."

Marisa:
I heard about the rumor, but I never thought it would be that easy.
That's pretty interes... uh, more like, mysterious.

Kasen:
I noticed something from Marisa earlier.

Reimu:
What's that?

Kasen:
Perfect Possession could take place by mutual consent, just like what we've been doing.
But now we know that in some cases, Perfect Possession could occur while bypassing the master's consciousness.

Reimu:
Yeah, I was totally unaware of it when I was perfect possessed.

Kasen:
If that's the case, it could be abused as a tool to one-sidedly take over anyone's body...

Reimu:
That's... a horrific hypothesis.

Mamizou:
Ha. The fact you people are here...
Means that you had started your own investigation. As quick as usual.

Mokou:
Why would you want this incident to end so fast? Don't you see how fun this is?
You can go as crazy as you want once you get good at it.

Reimu:
As perceptive as always.
And we've already had ones like you taking advantage of Perfect Possession. How terrific.

Mamizou:
I see. You're still picking on us without realizing how late you are.
Which means you literally know nothing about this incident.

Mokou:
Let's enjoy ourselves in this incident a little bit more!

Mamizou:
Looks like you don't know the trick of Perfect Possession yet.

Reimu:
We've already had abusers at this stage of the incident. Unbelievable.

Mamizou:
What are you talking about? Everyone should know the trick by now.
The trick that allows you to easily possess anyone.

Kasen:
The trick... You mean meditation?

Mamizou:
Well that's just one way to do it.
Either the master consents to it, or you look for moments when they're distracted.
Then you can just go ahead and possess them by entering meditative state.
It's almost too easy, isn't it?

Miko:
I see. You are taking action as well.

Reimu:
There's still nothing in progress though.
We're gonna figure things out when the time comes. Probably.

Hijiri:
What an unreliable shrine maiden.

Miko:
We've started our own investigation aside from yours.
And that's why we're teamed up. Now, could you at least not get in our way?

Reimu:
No way that's gonna happen.
Resolving incidents is my job and I'll finish it no matter how reckless it's gonna be!

Miko:
Finally, it's time for the strongest incident investigation team to move!

Miko:
I see. I'm a few techniques away from mastering Perfect Possession.

Reimu:
You two are too egoistic to cooperate. That's where the problem is.

Miko:
You may be right. I could've done it better all by myself.
I felt the use of Perfect Possession would be necessary for this investigation. So I had no choice but to form a team.
Turns out that cooperation is simply a waste of efforts.

Kasen:
Weren't you always saying that harmony is to be valued?

Miko:
That was just a warning to those who would oppose me.

Kasen:
Oh, now I get it...

Kasen:
It seems like everyone is getting fooled around by this rumor of Perfect Possession.

Reimu:
We didn't manage to learn anything important after today's investigation, either.
It will be a long battle, I suppose.

Kasen:
...And today is gonna be a long day.

Yukari:
Investigation that makes use of Perfect Possession...
Which is the worst, carefully crafted trap with pure malice. And you failed to choose the right way.

Reimu:
Yukari (You) ...! 
The fact that you come out at such timing, means that you must be related to the incident, again!

Yukari:
Forcibly possessing one's body is a deed of devils...
Or I should say, the pinnacle of all evils. Do I really look like someone who would commit such an act?

Reimu:
You do look like it! You look way too much like you would!
It would make no sense if you were not involved!

Reimu:
That was suspiciously easy...

Yukari:
How foolish... You don't understand the dangers behind Perfect Possession.
Then the Yorimashi (mediums) will have to learn via malice (danmaku) ! You danmaku-addled fools!

Yukari:
We won't be able to deal with the mastermind if that's all what you've got. This can't be any worse.

Marisa:
Hey! You there?! Let's fight!

Ichirin:
Hehe, sure thing.

Marisa:
Hehe. I just got some interesting power. It kind of feels like cheating though.
And I'm gonna test this on you until I get used to it. Be prepared!

Ichirin:
Oh, what a coincidence. I was just about to test my new power as well.

Marisa:
So...what now?

Futo:
I know this seems sketchy...
but we're doing this as a duo.

Koishi:
Aww. You two are doing the same Perfect Possession thing!
The plan was to beat you up two on one, and now it's all ruined!

Ichirin:
Your minds have never reached harmony as a duo. Why would you pair up like that?

Ichirin:
Awww. We lost.

Marisa:
Not really used to these fighting duo shenanigans yet, but we did win at least.
And I'm more surprised of the fact that you folks are also up for Perfect Possession.

Futo:
All right, next time I'll play the master.

Ichirin:
Yeah, yeah, I know, that's part of the deal.

Marisa:
Wha- you can switch masters that easily?!

Marisa:
This Perfect Possession thing is much simpler than I thought.
I could've sworn it had something to do with your power.

Koishi:
I thought so too! I was just about to say "I've finally grown stronger!" But that's not true. How disappointing.

Marisa:
If you can easily pair up with anyone, I'll probably just find someone else and say goodbye to this bummer.

Nitori:
Hey, you there! You're using Perfect Possession, right?

Marisa:
Oh, so you Kappas heard of it as well. The rumor of Perfect Possession.

Nitori:
I just got myself perfectly possessed and we're cracking on it. You're also a part of our experiment. Ready yourself please.

Kokoro:
Experiments are fun! Possession is also fun!

Marisa:
......
Nope, definitely not gonna pair up with these nuts.
Anyway, the new partner thing is on hold for now.

Nitori:
The analysis went well! The conditions for Perfect Possession are identical to what the rumor says.

Nitori:
I lost, but at least I got some good data for the experiment.

Marisa:
So what's the experiment?

Nitori:
This so-called Perfect Possession is obviously a byproduct of the Urban Legend Incident.
In other words, if the 
Urban Legend Incident gets resolved, then Perfect Possession will end along with it.

Marisa:
Don't tell me you're...

Nitori:
Heh heh heh. Mark my words, Artificial Perfect Possession will be completed before the end of the incident!

Marisa:
So Perfect Possession is popping up all over the place at the same time.
It's time to get serious.

Reimu:
Oh, you're back again?

Marisa:
How much progress have you made with your incident investigation?

Reimu:
Ah yeah, about that... We ran into a little problem.

Marisa:
Problem? What is it?

Reimu:
We're planning out our attack strategy right now.

Marisa:
You're planning an attack? So you've already found the root of the problem, yes? That was really fast.

Reimu:
Uh... how do I put this... oh, well. The thing is that our old, direct approach may not work for this Perfect Possession incident.

Marisa:
You're dodging the question and it's so obvious that you're hiding something.

Kasen:
What brought you here anyway? Playing with Perfect Possession duels just for fun?
If so, then we'll be your opponent. Take this as a warning.

Marisa:
Ah, er, yeah. But something's off about you Kasen. You're not usually this aggressive.

Kasen:
Hold nothing back!

Reimu:
For complete victory, I have no choice but to use you as a human sacrifice, Marisa.

Marisa:
All right! I won! I'm the strongest!

Koishi:
WE are the strongest!

Reimu:
We lost...
Oh well. I'll tell you the truth.

Koishi:
Yay! And this is where the fun begins!

Marisa:
This is starting to feel out of control...

Reimu:
You should hurry over to the Concert Stage of the Sun.
Something might be starting there.

Marisa:
So about the concert stage.
I heard The Prismrivers' concert is going live there tonight.
Don't tell me the culprit is...!

Koishi:
Is...?

Marisa:
.No, there's no way, right...?

Yukari:
Oh, why, hello there.

Marisa:
Yukari (You) ... You're here? Looks like we really are getting closer to the truth behind this incident.

Yukari:
You must've done your research on Perfect Possession to make your way here.
Incidentally, which species do you think specializes in possession?

Marisa:
Something without a body, something like a phantom...
Oh! No way! Don't tell me it's those marching band poltergeist sisters?!

Yukari:
Heh, if that were the case, then this would be resolved in an instant. Obviously not.

Marisa:
Figures. Phew, for some reason, I'm feeling relieved.

Yukari:
All right, that's enough of that.
Now, you'll have to make an important choice.

Marisa:
Huh? A choice?

Yukari:
To withdraw here and now, or to taste the truth for yourself.

Marisa:
A meaningless choice, as always. Who would anyone turn back after coming this far?

Yukari:
Oh yes, there's one more choice. To lose to me here and forget you ever had this conversation. Now, decide you two!

Yukari:
And I was even trying to lose on purpose... The plan failed.

Yukari:
Oh my, I lost.

Marisa:
Everyone else is using perfect possession, but you're the only one by yourself, huh?

Yukari:
Can you guess why that is?

Koishi:
Ooh, I know! It's 'cause you have no friends, right? So sad...

Yukari:
You'll find out soon enough. The Prismrivers' concert is about to begin,
and the most disastrous pair is going to be targeting the audience. Perhaps you'd like to see it for yourselves?

Marisa:
The concert's about to begin.

Koishi:
So excited for the concert! What music are they gonna play?

Marisa:
Hey hey, that's not what we're here for.
Something's gonna show up. We need to keep an eye out.

Koishi:
But we know who's gonna show up, right? The Prismrivers With H, right? We can't miss this! You're gonna regret it!!

Marisa:
Pairing up with Koishi was a mistake...

Joon:
We did it! The concert we all waited for! And soon they'll be playing the music!

Koishi:
Right?! This is gonna be so fun!

Joon:
Can't wait for the moment the audience stops thinking.

Koishi:
I love not thinking!

Marisa:
H-hey! Who're you?!

Joon:
Huh? What's it to you? Back off, trash.

Marisa:
What'd did you just say?!

Joon:
You. You made it this far by looking into perfect possession, huh?
I'll praise you for that at least.

Marisa:
So you're saying you're the one behind Perfect Possession then?!

Joon:
Correct! I'm Joon Yorigami, the goddess who brings wealth.

Marisa:
You bring wealth?

Koishi:
Oh? You seem like a nice person!

Joon:
Now, I'm gonna be ripping off the audience. Know your place and stay out of my way.

Marisa:
Wait, so when you say you bring wealth, you mean to yourself?

Joon:
Obviously. I'm not like my sister, I'm good at getting money.

Marisa:
Your sister?

Shion:
That's a cruel way to put it, Joon. It's not like I want to be poor.

Koishi:
Wah, some thin lady popped out of nowhere.

Shion:
You wouldn't be able to set up this perfect possession trap without me.

Joon:
Don't get any closer! You'll infect me with your poverty.

Marisa:
You two... What exactly are you after?

Joon:
We're gonna force perfect possession onto this huge crowd of people, taking their belongings, one after another.
People at a concert are especially defenseless, mentally, so this'll be a cinch.

Marisa:
Wait, so you're just a pickpocket? You caused this whole incident just for that?

Joon:
I'm no petty thief. All wealth naturally returns to me.

Shion:
It's because Joon is a plague god. Any human my little sister haunts will support her financially of their own will.

Shion:
And I'm Shion, a poverty god. I'm perfect possessing my sister because I thought I'd get in on this blessing.

Marisa:
A poverty god who's sisters with a plague god? Eugh, no way I'm getting anywhere near that!

Koishi:
Wow, it's like, they really are the worst, most disastrous pair.

Marisa:
But whatever, it's too late to back out. I'm ending your ambitions here and now!

Joon:
Oh, the concert's started.
I'm not letting a big chance like this slip away.

Shion:
Let's take care of this before the music ends. These girls don't even know what they're doing, this'll be quick.

Joon:
You got that right! I, the plague god...

Shion:
And I, the poverty god...

Joon & Shion:
We're the worst, most disastrous sisters! And we won't let you forget it!!

Joon:
You are indeed worthy as our opponents. However...

Marisa:
We aren't gonna lose against you ladies. Just look at that negative aura of yours. How would that bring you the victory?

Joon:
Ahahahaha! Your playtime has ended! Now, at this moment, your defeat has been set in stone!

Joon & Shion:
Possession Exchange "Absolute Loser!"

Futo:
Alright. Everything's ready.

Reimu:
What, it's just a kappa? We aren't here for sandbags.

Nitori:
Oho, what an unusual partnership. Well, whatever, let's go!

Futo:
Okay, let's continue the investigation into Perfect Possession.

Nitori:
Done! We got some good samples there!

Futo:
This is so frustrating. I want a rematch with a different slave.

Reimu:
Hate to admit, I'm still not good at being the slave. Gotta practice with different partners even more.

Nitori:
So how was it? Did you learn anything?

Kokoro:
I did. Those two are synchronized by feelings of frustration.

Ichirin:
Training for Perfect Possession duels? That's just what I was hoping for!

Nitori:
I'm glad that everyone is being so collaborative. It really makes things easier.

Marisa:
This vile kappa is known for unethical practices in her man-made Perfect Possession research. Be cautious.

Ichirin:
Man-made? Even though she's a kappa?

Nitori:
That's right.
Technology should be able to explain it soon enough, and you two will be one of our samples!

Ichirin:
This is not only for ourselves, but also for Lady Hijiri. That's why we must keep practicing.

Marisa:
Hmm, that didn't go so well.
By pairing up with Ichirin, we were a trio, counting the nyuudou.
That irregularity was supposed to lead me to a breakthrough, but if we can't win then what's the point?

Ichirin:
Wait, are you talking about that most wicked pair?
I'm also making an effort to capture them!

Marisa:
What, you too? I'd like to share what we know.

Nitori:
So how was it?

Kokoro:
Even though they lost the battle, it gave rise to feelings of solidarity.

Nitori:
As I thought, when people perform perfect possession, they share a portion of their feelings.
It seems that's due to sharing a portion of their spirit.
This is all because of your ability to see emotions caught my eye. Ergo, I am amazing.

Kokoro:
Since I had to memorize emotions logically, I got good at reading the emotions of others.

Nitori:
Your power to control emotions will be 
the key to analyzing perfect possession.

Shinmyoumaru:
Hey, there are practice partners right here. Let's have a perfect possession battle!

Nitori:
Everyone's just itching to use this new power, huh?
It's so easy to do experiments that I just can't stop laughing!

Kokoro:
Ahahaha.

Shinmyoumaru:
You think you've already won? Today I have the ultimate supporter as my slave!
I don't plan on losing!

Shinmyoumaru:
We won, but we don't really go well together, huh?

Shinmyoumaru:
I was supposed to have good compatibility with a tanuki, but we don't really go well together, huh?

Mamizou:
You got that right. I thought I'd be able to get stronger, but that was a letdown.
I'll never be a match for the most wicked pair like this.

Shinmyoumaru:
I must have a better match somewhere! If it's just 1+1=2, then that's such a waste!

Kokoro:
They're joined together by their strong desires.
In this case, sharing feelings through perfect possession was a weakness.

Nitori:
I see. So sharing feelings can be useless too.

Sumireko:
You're a kappa?

Nitori:
Yeah. You're the outsider?
So I'm guessing rumors of perfect possession haven't spread to the outside world?

Sumireko:
What's perfect possession?

Kokoro:
This.

Nitori:
You play around like that!

Sumireko:
Wow! You became a different person for an instant! A transformation ability?

Nitori:
It's a phenomenon called perfect possession. It's like normal possession, but you replace
the body along with the spirit.

Sumireko:
Taking over the body? So it's like teleportation then?
Show me again!

Kokoro:
Kaay.

Nitori:
Like that. If you're interested, then even you should be able to-
Wait, aren't you already possessed by something?

Sumireko:
Heh heh heh, so I got caught because of the incident?
But this isn't perfect possession.
I'm another Sumireko, driven out of the Dream World by perfect possession.
Dream Sumireko!

Sumireko:
Perfect possession is suppressing the Dream World.

Nitori:
Dream World Sumireko? What are you talking about?

Doremy:
It's just as she said.
Perfect possession is controlling the Dream World.
If this keeps up, the others selves being suppressed in the Dream World will be forced to go berserk.

Kokoro:
Oh no! I can't read this person's feelings!
It's possible that the synchronized feelings don't exist.

Nitori:
What the heck are you?

Doremy:
I am Doremy Sweet, the ruler of dreams.
From the standpoint of the Dream World, I think it'd be best if you refrained from abusing perfect possession.

Nitori:
Perfect possession is controlling the Dream World, huh?
Oh, I see. It was always a mystery where people were going when they're swapped out.
If we assume that they're in the Dream World, it all makes sense.

Kokoro:
That's probably the secret behind the sharing of feelings too.
Since when you have a scary thought in a dream, you wake up scared too.

Nitori:
Oho! It's all coming together! With this, there are no more obstacles to making artificial perfect possession a reality.

Kokoro:
Is it okay to ignore the warnings of the ruler of dreams though?

Nitori:
You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs! All we can do is keep moving forward so their sacrifice isn't in vain! Don't they realize that in the dream world?

Shinmyoumaru:
Oh, there they are! These two will make the perfect practice partners.

Tenshi:
There's another miserable place to live at the base of the cliff, I see.
All right, let's finish this quick!

Nitori:
What's with you two?

Shinmyoumaru:
After I fought you, I found the strongest partner!

Tenshi:
I'm Tenshi Hinanawi. A noble among nobles. A celestial.
It must be an honor for a lowly kappa to have me as a sparring partner.

Nitori:
What? A celestial? What a jerk.

Kokoro:
I get it.
Those two are joined by the feeling of having no brains. As in: "An empty head feels so niiiice~"

Tenshi:
I'll have you know that I'm a natural genius! But I don't let it get to my head, so I'm diligent with my training. I'm very humble, you know.
No one is a match for me! Now, be my sparring partner!

Nitori:
What a joke. What humility?
Well, whatever. Let's easily defeat her and put a crack in this celestial!

Tenshi:
So that's Perfect Possession! Isn't this entertaining!

Nitori:
This defies logic... Your Danmaku energy springs from nowhere!

Tenshi:
This is the power of all that lives! Kneel before the might of the living, peasant youkai!

Marisa:
Were you looking for me?

Mamizou:
Looking for someone to practice perfect possession with us. Are you in?

Marisa:
I've seen that a lot recently. Everyone's all about pursuing the greatness of power now, huh?
Sure, fight as you asked for.

Mamizou:
I like people like you who know the drill. Let's get started.

Marisa:
See? I'm getting used to this. The seat of the strongest perfect possessor will be mine!

Mamizou:
Thank you for the practice.

Marisa:
Uhh... it kind of hurts... What's the point of practicing that much though? Are you planning on something?

Mamizou:
Might is the prerequisite of all successes.

Mokou:
I'm just looking for some new excitement.

Marisa:
You two seem to have some... split opinions. Is your pair really gonna work?

Byakuren:
Alright. A practice match. Is this all you're asking for?

Mamizou:
We all know what to do at this point. I like it.
Since two versus one sounds unfair, go ahead and do your perfect possession.
...Or do you actually need some help with it?

Ichirin:
Oh, please. We knew how to do this all along.
It works as long as the master agrees.
And, if the master drops their guard... You can just possess them by force.

Mamizou:
Huh, so you've been under perfect possession, and you know it better than me. Amazing.

Byakuren:
You are not the only one who has done the research. En garde!

Byakuren:
You are no match to us, ad-libbers.

Mamizou:
I kinda adapted to this possession thing.

Mokou:
And this feel of possessing is getting nicer and nicer.
You are a lot better than what I could expect from a Tanuki.

Mamizou:
So are you. Your might and your martyrish zeal are yelling for our victory.

Byakuren:
Masterful.
But we haven't finished yet. Not before I find a stronger partner!

Ichirin:
Huh?

Reisen:
Practice match using perfect possession? Fine by me. But what makes a lone wolf like you group up all of a sudden?

Mokou:
In my eternal life, I've never had so much fun before this. Isn't it refreshing to take control of one's body?

Reisen:
Wait, how are you on the slave side? Who's the master?

Mamizou:
The master is me. We just had some common interests and it kinda worked out.

Shinmyoumaru:
Common interests! Just like us!

Mokou:
Huh? You grouped with that little cutie? Interesting.

Reisen:
Interests? More like hatreds!
She just one-sidedly decided to possess me and here I am!
You think I don't wanna find someone more capable? Come on.

Shinmyoumaru:
Stop treating me like a kindergartner! You're bound to win with me possessed!
You're chosen simply because you were a rabbit being careless! Just be glad that you were the one being possessed!
First round, get ready!

Reisen:
So that's perfect possession. It's indeed interesting when you use it right.

Reisen:
Aww. I lost.

Shinmyoumaru:
This rabbit sucks! Gotta possess somebody who's better than this.

Reisen:
No, apparently you sucked! Gosh...

Mamizou:
It really is as the rumor said. Everyone can forcibly sneak in once the master drops their guard.
But, it's still the master that dictates what they wanna do with their bodies.
I guess most of them didn't have the luxury to choose their slaves willingly as they liked...
Ha. I wonder why they added it to the rumor, hmm.
...The rabbit there.
Do you know if there are any popular events incoming near this area?

Reisen:
Huh? Events? Oh! Actually...

Mamizou:
Hmm. So that "concert" thing is gonna be hosted here.
Humans should be gathering around the stage from now on, as she said.

Mokou:
What happened? Any ideas on who we're gonna face next?

Mamizou:
Who knows. But we might meet someone who's never been seen before.
It's just the case where we actually meet the mastermind of perfect possession though.

Yukari:
Woah! A Prismrivers' concert. I'm so looking forward to it.
Hey, both of you are also coming for the live music?

Mamizou:
Not my cup of tea.

Yukari:
Then... You're coming for "that?" There is nothing except "that" to be honest.

Mamizou:
"That?" Yeah, I figured, you aren't the live concert type.
The one who spread the rumor of perfect possession. We're camping here waiting for them to show up.

Yukari:
Perfect possession? I'm not talking about that. I meant "that."

Mamizou:
What IS "that" then?

Yukari:
Ticket scalping. It's that obvious, dear scalpers?

Mamizou:
Scalpers? That's not even funny. Quit faking it. You knew everything all along.

Mokou:
Hey, chief. Just a quick note. This is one of the most suspicious figures here in Gensokyo.

Mamizou:
I've heard of that.
Here, listen, Mokou. We ain't practicing anymore.
It's the time for our perfect possession strategies to get real. Stay focused!

Mokou:
I've been wanting this for so long! Here, take my life and let it be as many as you wish!

Yukari:
I feel like it would've worked better for you if you just do it one by one.

Yukari:
Two versus one, this is not fair.

Mamizou:
Hey, don't tell me now that you were actually here for the concert.

Yukari:
Hmm. You two should be able to do it.

Mamizou:
What's that about?

Yukari:
Let's start with the mastermind of the Perfect Possession Incident. That's what you're looking for, isn't it?

Mokou:
And of course you're related.

Yukari:
It's not my work.
In fact, I'm getting annoyed by their arrogant, outrageous acts.

Mokou:
Ha, the one that actually annoys a youkai like you.
I've always wanted to fight someone like that!

Yukari:
They will show themselves in this concert soon.
And they will attempt to possess all of the audience as they are relaxed by the music.

Mamizou:
Did you just say ALL of them? Unbelievable.
And you're here trying to stop it. Is that what this is all about?

Yukari:
Well, I hoped that was the case. But...

Mamizou:
But what? Don't worry. We're the best of all, and we'll get this over with.

Mokou:
Audiences will be coming in soon. I'm waiting in the wings!

Mamizou:
Hehe. Not even a standing ticket left. The Prismrivers' popularity is going through the roof.

Mokou:
An up-tempo song, but filled with a nihilistic view of life and death. Sounds like a hit.

Mamizou:
Hmm. You surely know a lot about them. I guess you are a fan? No?

Mokou:
N-No...? A-Anyway, it's starting soon, be prepared.

Joon:
We did it! The concert we all waited for! And soon they'll be playing the music!
Can't wait for the moment where they lower their guards to the music!

Mamizou:
We have been waiting for you.

Joon:
Who are you? You're ruining the fun, strangers.

Mamizou:
I am Mamizou Futatsuiwa, the bake-danuki. I am here to present you the strongest pair among all perfect possessors.

Joon:
Perfect possessors? Hmm. Let me see...

Mamizou:
By our prediction, the mastermind of the Perfect Possession Incident will show themselves here. And you're the best candidate.

Joon:
As you expected. After all this time.

Mamizou:
You spread the rumor of perfect possession so that you can take over the audience once they lose their minds to the music.
Such a well-hidden plan, but your execution went too loud.
We took the advantage from it, and we have reached our new pinnacle of strength.
Now, show me what you got!

Joon:
Really? Are you people stupid?
You weren't wrong about the intention. We did plan to take over everyone in the audience here.
And what makes you think that spreading rumors aloud would be a mistake? It was obviously on purpose!

Mamizou:
What did you say?

Joon:
I am Joon Yorigami. The worst, most disastrous plague god! And...

Shion:
I'm her older sister, Shion Yorigami. The worst, most disastrous poverty god.

Mamizou:
A plague god accompanied with a poverty god!?

Mokou:
Now it's two versus two. No point in holding back now!

Joon & Shion:
We're the worst, most disastrous sisters! And we won't let you forget it!

Mokou:
Was that all you got? It wasn't even a warm-up!

Joon:
Ahahaha.

Mamizou:
How unpleasant... What's so funny there?

Joon:
It's funny because you have no idea that your brawn is no match for the true savagery!

Joon & Shion:
Possession Exchange "Absolute Loser!"

Miko:
I have no grudge with you, but I need you to be a test subject.

Koishi:
Test subject?

Byakuren:
Now, Ichirin.

Ichirin:
Got it! Is this really okay?

Byakuren:
All right, the compulsory perfect possession was a success.

Miko:
How simple. Is that because the subject doesn't appear to have any thoughts?

Koishi:
Huh? What was that...? Was I perfectly possessed by someone just now?

Miko:
Oh? So you're enough of an adult to understand what perfect possession is?
That simplifies the discussion. You'll be helping us study everything there is to know about perfect possession!

Koishi:
All right, we won!

Ichirin:
Sorry, I got carried away.

Miko:
So in the end, there isn't much difference between perfect possession when both consent and compulsory perfect possession?

Koishi:
Whuh? When did I get possessed? What's this about an experiment?

Byakuren:
Sorry for startling you. An experiment on compulsory perfect possession can't be performed without a surprise.

Miko:
When both parties consent, then perfect possession is a simple matter.
And when one party lets their guard down, mentally, then compulsory perfect possession is possible.
But why would the mastermind spread the second condition...?

Koishi:
Ah... so then, when I was unconscious I went all over the place possessing people.

Miko:
Oh, so you have experience with this then? I have many questions for you.

Miko:
Looks like we've found another person likely to let their guard down, mentally.
Now, do it!

Kokoro:
Eh? What's this all of a sudden?

Futo:
Success! She's perfectly possessed.

Miko:
Well done. Now, I'm counting on you to investigate what we discussed.

Kokoro:
Huh? What's going on?

Byakuren:
You've just been possessed by an evil spirit! You'll die unless you resist it!

Kokoro:
What? What? What are you saying, I don't get it!

Miko:
We'll be your opponents, so let loose to your heart's content! Show us you can break free from that evil spirit!

Kokoro:
I won. Seeing the double religious leaders working together was so weird that it's scary though.

Miko:
So how are you feeling?

Futo:
Very comfortable.

Kokoro:
I'm not comfortable at all! Why'd you possess me?! Get out!

Futo:
There's no change even when the subject resists.

Miko:
I see. Now I understand. Thank you for your cooperation, madam.

Kokoro:
You're not gonna explain?!

Miko:
I'm starting to see it.
The difference between consensual possession and compulsory possession.
I'll just need one last experiment to prove it.

Byakuren:
The lord of this castle never seems to have a thought in her head, so she'd be the perfect subject.

Miko:
An inchling, was it? True, she does have a much smaller brain.

Tenshi:
Hey, so who are you?

Shinmyoumaru:
Gah, it's that annoying lady who thinks she's the greatest thing in Gensokyo!

Tenshi:
Hmm? But is there any difference between a great person and a dead person if they're both crawling around on the Earth?

Shinmyoumaru:
Yeah! That's my celestial! I can count on you!

Ichirin:
The inchling won't work! She's already someone else's slave, so we can't use compulsory possession on her.

Futo:
And that mysterious master doesn't have the slightest opening in her heart either!

Miko:
...Understood.
Then we'll have to cancel the experiment and switch to normal battle mode.

Tenshi:
Oh? So we're doing it? It's been a while since I've been in a blood-gushing, flesh-pounding battle!

Tenshi:
Grovel in the dirt, insects! Don't disappoint me now!

Tenshi:
Perfect possession, huh? Something interesting is happening on the surface, huh?

Miko:
After all that talk, you were that weak? What a disappointment.

Tenshi:
I'm still not used to this perfect possession, that's all!
If I'd practiced, there's no way I'd lose to a surface-dweller!

Miko:
Then practice. Devote yourself to it.
Incidentally, she mentioned you were a celestial. Is that true?

Tenshi:
That's right.

Miko:
I see. I was afraid of that. Celestials were supposed to be far more powerful than that. You're pathetic. I don't even want to look at you.

Tenshi:
I told you! Just a little training and I'll be the strongest!
And I'd finally found an inchling with good compatibility...
We'll be the strongest pair before you know it! Just watch me! You insect!

Byakuren:
Where is this?

Miko:
A concert stage.. The Prismriver orchestra will be playing a show here after this.

Byakuren:
Is anyone going to show up here?

Miko:
No, I'm the owner. I'm going to give a speech before the audience.

Byakuren:
Huh? Owner? What? No one ever mentioned this!

Miko:
This sort of steady activity is how you gather patrons.

Yukari:
I can hardly wait for the concert.

Miko:
You... If I recall correctly, you're the one they say rules Gensokyo from the shadows.

Yukari:
Oh my, you're investigating the perfect possession? Without anyone asking you to? How conscientious of you.

Miko:
What are you here for? Surely you're not here to see the concert.

Yukari:
And paired up with your business rival at that... But I can see that it will all end with you two fighting each other, with a very unfortunate outcome at that.

Miko:
Answer the question. What are you here for?

Yukari:
Hey, do you think the two of you could leave the rest of the investigation to me?

Miko:
Are you trying to say that because we arrived here later, we have to turn over what we know?!
Ridiculous! Foolish! I have no words! I am truly disappointed in you, from the bottom of my heart!
It's two against one, no need to hold back! Come at us with everything!

Yukari:
Now, will you tell me what you learned in your investigation? I don't like to lose when I'm serious.

Miko:
You weren't even serious, were you? I've lost interest.

Yukari:
That was enough. I could tell what you've learned from how you fought.
Now, I should tell you what I know too.

Miko:
You have information?

Yukari:
I already know who the culprit behind the Perfect Possession Incident is.

Miko:
What did you say?!

Yukari:
But you see, I don't know how to defeat them.
That's why I wanted information. I'm telling the truth.

Miko:
Who would believe that?
Couldn't you very well be the mastermind yourself?!

Byakuren:
...The information we obtained that wasn't in the rumors is that:
When the perfect possession is consensual, the master has the power to dismiss it.
But when the perfect possession is compulsory, the slave does.

Miko:
Hey!

Byakuren:
I've seen many humans confess their worries.
If she's lying, I'll know right away.
She's not telling the whole truth, but the part about knowing the culprit isn't a lie.
She's implied that if we give her our information,she'll tell us who it is.
Or that's the impression I've gotten, so wouldn't it be faster to just tell her?

Yukari:
Heh heh heh.
It appears the monk is the more worldly of the two.
That truly was good data you've given me. So I'll be giving you my best information as well.

Miko:
The mastermind will appear at the start of the concert?

Byakuren:
Looks like it will start soon. I suppose this is perfect timing?

Miko:
But still, this is bad. I've figured out the culprit's goal!

Joon:
Alright! Looking forward to the concert!
Can't wait for the moment when the audience has its heart stolen!

Miko:
That's far enough. The Perfect Possession incident led us to you!

Joon:
Hm? Who are you?
Oh, I've seen you around before! You're that saint who just won't shut up.
Oh, and even that monk who plays the saint for popularity.

Miko:
Who are you? Name yourself.

Joon:
I'm Joon Yorigami, the goddess who brings wealth.

Byakuren:
Brings wealth? What a bald-faced lie. I can't feel anything from you but a powerful negative aura.

Miko:
I know what you're after.
You'll be doing compulsory perfect possession when the audience is engrossed in the concert.
As for what you'll do next... based on your gaudy appearance I'm assuming you'll take their money?

Joon:
Wow, you figured out all that?
But yeah, exactly. When the audience is distracted, I can possess whoever I want.

Miko:
You fiend! Stealing the belongings of others is the lowest of the low!

Byakuren:
Thou shalt not steal! To think this incident was caused by a despicable petty thief! This world is beyond saving.

Miko:
I couldn't agree more. We should rid the world of this degenerate buffoon.

Joon:
Ah ha ha! You're the buffoons! You think you can beat me?
Degenerate? Despicable? Lovely! Music to my ears!

Shion:
Hey, Joon. We've gotta deal with these two, the concert's starting.

Miko:
What? There was a pair of degenerates?

Joon:
I'm the worst, most disastrous plague god.

Shion:
And I'm her older sister, Shion Yorigami. The worst, most disastrous poverty god.
Personally, I'm reluctant, but you can't beat us.

Joon & Shion:
We're the worst, most disastrous sisters! And we won't let you forget it!

Miko:
The righteous shall stand, and the vile shall fall. Now, begone!

Shion:
How shiny, how glaring... The brighter you shine, the more delighted I am!

Miko:
What?

Shion:
Because as you shine brighter, I'll get to see an even more bitter look on your face!

Joon & Shion:
Possession Exchange "Absolute Loser!"

Futo:
Salutations! Let us have a perfect possession duel!

Shinmyoumaru:
Sure thing! But you found me before I could possess anyone, so could you hold on a bit?

Futo:
No, but aren't thou already possessed?

Shinmyoumaru:
Huh?

Koishi:
Tada! Random possession was A! Huge! Success!

Futo:
Compulsory possession, huh? No matter, let's duel!

Shinmyoumaru:
Scary! When did I get possessed?!

Shinmyoumaru:
I lost! Not only do I get possessed by some weirdo I don't really know, but then I lose. What a disgrace.

Futo:
Thy combination was the worst. Thou needst more training.

Shinmyoumaru:
So not only do I get partnered up with someone I didn't want, but then I get lectured. What a disgrace.

Ichirin:
Heeey! It's about time for us to switch like you promised!

Futo:
Oh, is that so? My apologies.

Ichirin:
All right! Next I'm the master! Hey, you! Let's have a perfect possession duel!

Mokou:
Good timing. I was just thinking about doing some training on the master's side.

Reisen:
A monk and a hermit? I thought you were rivals. I'm surprised to see you together.

Ichirin:
This was Lady Hijiri's plan. We're researching perfect possession together.

Mokou:
Who cares? As long as you aren't weak!

Mokou:
Yeah, figures I wouldn't be any good at being the master.

Ichirin:
Your teamwork's all messed up. You're not used to working together.

Mokou:
Personally I'm fine with just being the slave. As long as I can go wild when it's my turn.

Ichirin:
Is that how it is? I thought everyone would prefer seizing power as the master.

Mokou:
But isn't it easier to focus on the fight when you can leave the timing of the swaps to someone else?

Ichirin:
If you'd rather be the slave, there's always the compulsory possession method.

Mokou:
You mean that thing where you can possess people who have their guards down by meditating deeply?

Ichirin:
Yeah, that. Oh, whoops, it's time for us to switch, but...
I can't contact Futo. What do I do now?

Mokou:
You're taking turns being the master? What an interesting pair.

Ichirin:
It's because we had this huge fight over who would be the master.
Oh, I know! Since there's no contact from Futo, maybe I take this opportunity try an experiment with compulsory possession?

Futo:
Hmm, what a bizarre place.

Ichirin:
Looks like the compulsory possession was a success, but...
Hey you, where is this?

Futo:
No idea. I don't even know when I got here.

Doremy:
This is a surprise.
So someone in the Dream World is being perfectly possessed?

Futo:
Didst thou say Dream World?

Doremy:
Normally, you can't possess people in the Dream World.
But in your case, the master had something like consent to being possessed.
A master being able to give consent while half-asleep is exceedingly rare.

Ichirin:
Wait, so you're sleeping?

Futo:
Er... no? What's going on?
More importantly, we can continue the investigation. See, isn't the person before us possessed?
This is a perfect possession experiment!

Doremy:
It's a fight then!
However, you're mistaken. I'm not affected by perfect possession.
I'm merely escorting wandering dream souls. But if you're fine with it, then I am too.

Doremy:
If you're defeated in a dream, you can't get revenge. I'm sure it's humiliating.

Futo:
We won!
But thou usest none but mysterious attacks I've never seen before. Who art thou?

Doremy:
I am Doremy Sweet, the ruler of dreams.
Perfect possession is hijacking your Dream World self.
I want you to remember that it's a demonic act that steals from the land of dreams.

Futo:
What dost thou mean?

Doremy:
When you're perfectly possessed, you become unable to see dreams.
And I suppose the dream disappears off to who-knows-where while that's happening.

Futo:
Hm. I understand not of what thou speakest.
I'm losing consciousness...

Doremy:
The master must have woken up.
At this rate, the people of the Dream World driven out by their bodies will start to run wild.
I hope this Perfect Possession Incident gets resolved before something horrific happens.

Ichirin:
Huh? Weren't we just in the Dream World?

Futo:
My head feels all fuzzy, like I just had the strangest dream...

Ichirin:
You too then? I've already forgotten what happened...
Well, whatever. Let's restart our investigation into perfect possession.

Kasen:
So how is it? Have you gotten used to being the slave yet?

Reimu:
Hmm. It just feels so restricting.
I just can't handle not having control.

Kasen:
You just lack a cooperative spirit.
Oh, you have guests?

Ichirin:
Hello. We're here to research perfect possession.
Although it looks like you're doing your own investigation too.

Kasen:
I've heard. Even your bosses are cooperating for the investigation.
Although apparently, you're nowhere close to resolving the incident.

Ichirin:
That's just a matter of time. Time which will be slightly shorter if you work with us.

Kasen:
But, well, this is perfect timing. Our own incident resolver is undergoing special training.
Let's fight to help her get used to being the slave! Don't hold back!

Kasen:
You were far too weak to even be useful as training.

Ichirin:
All right! We won! Don't tell me we're actually the strongest?!

Futo:
Not bad at all. We have bested the hermit and shrine maiden combo.
I feel as though we won't lose to anyone!

Kasen:
Simple strength won't make you the most powerful pair.
I'm sure the same can be said of your bosses.

Ichirin:
Geez, someone's a sore loser.

Futo:
Sore loser!

Reimu:
Let's just leave it at that. I'll win in the end anyway.

Byakuren:
Good work on the investigation. Did you discover anything new?

Futo:
'Twas a difficult, but worthwhile task.

Byakuren:
Glad to hear it. I'm sure it will help us capture that plague and poverty god combo.

Futo:
About that...
Give us the task of defeating the ultimate evil. No, please let us do it.

Byakuren:
Excuse me?

Futo:
After being in countless perfect possession battles, I've come to realize something.
Thou canst not realize how it pains me to say this, but there is a problem in thy teamwork.
However, we can fight without being constrained by the concept of master and slave!

Miko:
Oho. Now isn't that interesting?
So in other words, you're saying that you're stronger than us.

Futo:
Ah, no, I mean-

Miko:
Wa ha ha! You needn't mind, it doesn't bother me at all. Splendid!

Byakuren:
Ichirin, do you think so too?

Ichirin:
Yeah, I think we can win! Ah, I mean, against the plague and poverty god combo. Obviously.

Miko:
You certainly talk big. Then show us your true ability.
Is that all right with you, Byakuren Hijiri? This sort of sideshow isn't bad at all.

Byakuren:
I suppose if I must. It seems real combat has made them a bit overconfident.
Very well then, show us what you've learned in your investigation!

Byakuren:
Good job, ladies.

Futo:
We're still ready for some more, bring it on!

Byakuren:
But, remind yourself... that overconfidence only leads to failures!
And now you'll learn the same lesson as we did!

Byakuren:
Sheesh, you let it get to your head so easily.

Reisen:
...The wavelengths aren't long.
The light of madness the moon is giving off tonight is a step above.
Bad things happen on days like this.

Reimu:
So it really was you, then?
I heard a rabbit of insanity was rampaging in the bamboo thicket.

Reisen:
Gah. That unbelievable intuition of yours...

Reimu:
Well, I heard "insanity", so it was obviously you.

Reisen:
Right right. I didn't mean to rampage though.

Reimu:
Huh? You're acting a little different from normal?

Reisen:
Oho!

Reisen:
Just what I'd expect from the shrine maiden, you got it right away.
I am the Reisen Udongein Inaba from the Dream World.
I'm a different Reisen, not the one you know!

Reimu:
Wow. What a terrible joke... Maybe you're the usual Reisen after all.

Reisen:
Why don't you fight me and see if I'm joking?

Reimu:
What a weird Reisen.

Reimu:
I can't believe you're in a team with the ruler of dreams. Why...?

Doremy:
This Reisen isn't the Reisen you know.
She really is a Reisen from the Dream World.

Reimu:
Hmm. Still no clue what you're talking about.
But if you're here, then maybe it's not so bad?

Doremy:
Consider it a side effect of perfect possession.
You should keep that in mind too.

Reisen:
Hee hee hee, this is the first time I've been in the real world! I can't wait to see what's waiting for me!

Reisen:
Get out here!

Byakuren:
Oh my, the moon rabbit?
I've learned something in my research since the Urban Legend Incident.
I've heard it said that they found someone who appeared to be the ringleader of the incident?
And they were definitely a Lunarian. At this point it seems clear that Eientei had something to do with the Urban Legend Incident.
But what are your thoughts?

Reisen:
Who cares about any of that crap?

Byakuren:
Excuse me?

Reisen:
Apparently I'm subconsciously annoyed with you,
and I won't feel better unless we fight.

Byakuren:
What is it? You wish to fight a battle using perfect possession?

Reisen:
Perfect possession, huh? I have to give my thanks for that.
Without it, I wouldn't have been able to come out to the real world.

Byakuren:
I'm not following. You speak as if you're from another world.

Doremy:
Correct. This here isn't the Reisen you know. It's a Reisen from the Dream World.

Byakuren:
Oh, so you've been perfectly possessing her. And who might you be?

Doremy:
I am Doremy Sweet, the ruler of the Dream World. A pleasure to meet you.

Reisen:
That's enough chit-chat. I'm finally here in the real world, so now I can say the stuff I can't say normally!
You damned hypocritical biker priest! How dare you look down on me when I was here first!
I'm gonna screw up that calm face of yours with madness!

Byakuren:
What was that about...?

Reisen:
Whew, that felt good. I enjoyed that.

Byakuren:
What an unpleasant feeling. Like I heard some outrageous things before the fight.

Doremy:
The residents of the Dream World are especially sensitive.
What they express are their normal feelings multiplied several times over.

Byakuren:
So she does feel that way normally, then.

Reisen:
Alright! Now time for the next one!

Miko:
Oho. So you've come to challenge me to a duel, fair and square. How could I refuse?

Reisen:
That condescending attitude is just disgusting!
You talk big, but when's the last time you actually did something?!

Miko:
Wh-What's this? You've become able to speak freely now, timid moon rabbit?

Reisen:
I'm just telling it like it is.

Miko:
Here I thought you'd be trembling feebly, but it seems something has been lifted from you.
Very well, then allow to speak frankly as well. As a result of my investigation, I've uncovered the mastermind behind the Urban Legend Incident.
Gensokyo had gotten wrapped up in the Lunar Capital's meaningless disturbance.
However, currently, the real threat is the Perfect Possession Incident, which was made possible by abusing the Urban Legend Incident.
The problem has become not that of a faraway war, but a lover's quarrel close at hand.
Perhaps, you, a moon rabbit, might know more than I?

Reisen:
I don't care about that crap!
I just wanna beat you black and blue and let off some of this frustration!

Doremy:
Please don't take this to be the truth.

Miko:
Hm? And who are you?

Doremy:
I am Doremy Sweet, the ruler of the Dream World. A pleasure to meet you.
The Reisen here is the Reisen of the Dream World.

Miko:
A Dream World Reisen? Explain.

Doremy:
The residents of the Dream World are especially sensitive and honest.

Reisen:
Just shut up!
Fight me already, you wicked hermit in love with your own voice!
This Gensokyo is filled with people who'd celebrate your disappearance! I am a hero of justice!

Miko:
It seems you've been possessed by someone led astray from human compassion.
Very well then, I will open your eyes!

Miko:
To think the rabbit of madness would go mad herself.

Reisen:
Ah, that feels better. Now I'll feel great when I wake up.

Miko:
Is it true that you're the Reisen from the Dream World?

Reisen:
Yup. Doing whatever I want in the real world feels sooo good.

Miko:
Even though I'm pursuing the truth behind the perfect possession, I'm busy. I'm not going to play along with your drivel.

Doremy:
About that perfect possession though...
It's having an effect on the Dream World.

Miko:
Oh really, now? Keep talking.

Doremy:
While you're being perfectly possessed, your partner is hidden in the Dream World.
As a result, the corresponding Dream World resident is expelled.
The Reisen you see before you is a result of that.

Miko:
My word! So it was affecting even the Dream World...?
If that's true, then we need to resolve this incident immediately.

Doremy:
Time's up. It's time to return to the Dream World.

Reisen:
Whaat? But I still wanna go wild!

Doremy:
While it is important to let your feelings out in reality to avoid going berserk,
if you remain in the real world for too long, balance will be lost.

Reisen:
Can I have just one more fight then? Who knows when I'll get another chance.

Doremy:
Hmm... It's still dangerous, but...
Looking at you, you still seem to be suffering, so...
Very well. This next fight will be the last.

Reisen:
Alright! Thanks for being so understanding!

Mokou:
Found ya. So you're the weird Reisen from the rumors.

Reisen:
Perfect timing! My last opponent will be you, immortal!
C'mon, let's fight!

Mokou:
Wow, that makes me so happy. I can't believe cute little Reisen is challenging me to a fight.

Reisen:
Hee hee hee, I've had problems with you for a long time now!
You think I'm gonna let a disturbance like you stick around in the bamboo thicket!

Mokou:
Come to think of it, that time I switched with Reimu and fought you was the beginning of the Perfect Possession Incident, wasn't it?
You've grown so much since then that I barely recognize you.
Since then, I've mastered using perfect possession and gotten many times stronger. But how about you?
If your power and righteousness aren't all talk, then show me!

Mokou:
I see. You're not just a bragger.

Reisen:
There's no time left! Come at me with everything you've got!

Mokou:
Since you asked! I'll perish you in one-shot!
My flame of life! Burn to the ends of the earth!

Mokou:
So it was all talk, then.

Sumireko:
Oh? I nodded off as usual, but where's this?

Reimu:
Oh, it's Sumireko. How weird, to run into you in a place like this.

Sumireko:
Ah, Reimers. If you're here, then this must be Gensokyo.

Reimu:
Does this look like Gensokyo to you?

Sumireko:
?

Reimu:
You're the real Sumireko! You don't belong here!
Open your eyes!

Reimu:
This place is neither the outside world, nor Gensokyo.

Reimu:
Ah ha ha, you're like a little lost child.

Sumireko:
You're acting weird, Reimu. I just wanted to stop by Kourindou...

Reimu:
If you want to escape, then find the other Sumireko.

Sumireko:
That's weird. I can't teleport to anywhere I know.
No matter what I do, I can't get out of this creepy world.

Marisa:
So you're lost.

Sumireko:
Ah! Rissa~!
I'm saved! You gotta listen, I can't get out of here!

Marisa:
Heh heh. Can't get out?

Marisa:
Even though this world is so free?!

Sumireko:
Wha? What are you-

Marisa:
Blame that perfect possession stuff. There's less time to be free.

Sumireko:
No! You're not Marisa!

Marisa:
Ah ha ha! Of course I'm Marisa. No doubt about that.

Sumireko:
Reimu was acting weird earlier too!
You look exactly the same, but inside it's like you're completely different.
Don't tell me I'm lost in some crazy world? A parallel dimension?!

Marisa:
I'm not sure if that's good intuition or a terrible one.
This is the Dream World. You're sleeping.

Sumireko:
This is the Dream World?
Wasn't Gensokyo my dream world?

Doremy:
I'll explain.

Sumireko:
Uwah! Something just dropped down!
Wait, what? Haven't I seen you before?

Doremy:
I've been perfectly possessing you the whole time.
All the real humans who disappear into the Dream World like Lu Sheng and Zhuangzi tend to lose their sense of self.
So to make sure that doesn't happen to you, I'm observing you through perfect possession.

Sumireko:
Perfect possession...? What's that?

Doremy:
Perfect possession is an act that takes over someone's personality and flesh, everything.

Sumireko:
So in other words, I'm possessed? By you?

Doremy:
Exactly.

Sumireko:
No way no way no way! Get out of me!

Doremy:
Now then. I have to stop the dream dwellers from rampaging.

Doremy:
Even if you defeat me, it doesn't change a thing.

Sumireko:
What the heck are you...?

Doremy:
I am Doremy Sweet, the ruler of dreams.

Sumireko:
The ruler of dreams...? Then this really is the Dream World?

Doremy:
Every time you dream, you've visited Gensokyo.
Normally what's happening is that you expel your dream self, which is then taken over by your real self.
By being in the Dream World, you're currently an irregularity.

Sumireko:
Hmm... I don't really get it. So, in the end, what's happening to me?

Doremy:
Your suppressed Dream World self is running wild.
She went to the real world and is rampaging as you.
I'm sure she's acting out even more because of how much you've been suppressing her.
In the meantime, you won't be able to leave the Dream World.

Sumireko:
So I can't leave the Dream World? That's a problem.
Is there anything I can do?

Doremy:
If you think about what you've been doing to your Dream Self, it's only fair that you endure at least this much.
And naturally, there's nothing you can do about it.

Doremy:
What? She vanished?
That's odd. Did something happen to her dream self?
Oh well. I'll just keep splitting myself to keep an eye on her through perfect possession.

Sumireko:
Ow ow ow, I feel like someone grabbed me.

Doremy:
This is the real world, huh? It seems you were forcefully dragged out of the Dream World.

Sumireko:
What? This is the usual Gensokyo then? Alright!

Yukari:
Hello.

Sumireko:
Good evening. Who're you?

Yukari:
I am Yukari Yakumo. I've come to offer you a helping hand.

Sumireko:
So you're the one who took me out of that strange world. Thanks, I owe you one.

Doremy:
This is unacceptable. You're not allowed to interfere with the Dream World without permission. There are rules.

Yukari:
Oh, and residents of the Dream World rampaging throughout Gensokyo isn't against those rules?
The Dream World Sumireko has been going on quite a frenzy over here, you know.
I simply took this unruly child out of the Dream World to send her back to the outside world.

Sumireko:
What? To the outside world? But I'd finally gotten back to Gensokyo!

Yukari:
I won't hear it! Now disappear!

Yukari:
I've already sent the Dream World Sumireko to the outside world.

Doremy:
I don't care what your reasons are, I can't have you meddling with the Dream World.
Even Dream Sumireko's rampage is essentially caused by what people in the real world are doing.
Shouldn't you deal with that first then?

Yukari:
Huh? What do you mean by that?

Doremy:
The dream dwellers are rampaging because of the Perfect Possession Incident.
As long as you haven't resolved that, the Dream World will definitely continue to influence reality.

Yukari:
Tell me everything, please.

Doremy:
While they're in perfect possession, the slave expels the master's dreams and ends up in the Dream World.
The expelled dream dwellers are rampaging in the real world.

Yukari:
To think that perfect possession had such a side effect... You've been very informative.

Doremy:
But this girl's situation is especially complicated.
It seems she's being affected by not only the Perfect Possession Incident, but also the urban legends.
Oh, that's perfect! Do you know where the Dream World Sumireko is right now?

Yukari:
In that case...

Sumireko:
What? I'm back in the real world?!
My body's supposed to be asleep at home, but what's gonna happen now?

Doremy:
Thanks to that boundary youkai from before, it seems both your dream self and your real self are here at the same time.
She set us up. At this rate, the line between dreams and reality will become blurred.

Sumireko:
Hey, is that me?

Sumireko (opponent/master):
Hey, it's me! What's going on?

Sumireko:
What? You're the fake!

Sumireko (opponent/master):
What? I'm Sumireko. Aren't you the fake?

Doremy:
The one in front of us was supposed to be the dream dweller, so why...?

Sumireko (opponent/slave):
Don't screw with me! Both my master and you are the fakes!

Doremy:
Why is Sumireko possessing Sumireko?

Sumireko:
Whaaat? There are two fake me's?

Sumireko (opponent/slave):
Stop chirping, you fake! The real one should have the strongest psychic powers!

Sumireko (opponent/master):
Shut up, both of you! The winner will be the real one!

Sumireko:
No idea why this is happening, but the real one would never lose! Let's settle this!

Sumireko:
Aghhh! None of this makes any sense!

Sumireko (opponent/master):
Not bad! But that's not an excuse for pretending to be me!

Sumireko (opponent/slave):
I'm gonna deal with you impostors one-by-one!

Sumireko:
Huh? Let's see who's the real deal here!

Sumireko Sumireko(s):
I, am the true, strongest Esper here! Cast yourself away, fakes!
We, are the true, strongest Espers here! Cast yourself away, fake!

Sumireko Sumireko:
I'm the real Sumireko!

Tenshi:
Who's this?

Shinmyoumaru:
A trainee monk at the temple. A youkai monk who's best buds with a nyuudou.

Tenshi:
A nyuudou? Oh, you mean that cloud-bug.

Shinmyoumaru:
Cloud-bug?

Tenshi:
From heaven, a nyuudou looks like just another bug.

Ichirin:
Wait, haven't I seen you somewhere...?

Tenshi:
Hm? Have we met?

Ichirin:
You were watching when I was fighting with Lady Hijiri. The celestial, right?

Tenshi:
None other! A high-class human the likes of which you rabble will never even reach the feet of!

Ichirin:
Both Lady Hijiri and Miss Miko said there was a good-for-nothing delinquent celestial.

Tenshi:
Ah?

Ichirin:
And that a real celestial would be compassionate and strong in battle.

Tenshi:
Oho, now you've said it. Even though you're a worm fit only to grovel in the dirt.
This is perfect. Witness the battle of one such celestial!

Ichirin:
Wow, you're weak. This is what the people in heaven are like? What a disappointment.

Tenshi:
Hmph! A nyuudou and a kappa don't go together at all. Obviously I'd win.

Shinmyoumaru:
You're really getting the hang of it! We're definitely the ultimate combo!

Tenshi:
Hee hee hee. Speaking of inchlings, your kind can trace their lineage back to a wise and skilled race of nobility.
I'm so glad I met an excellent partner worthy of me.

Tenshi:
Who's this?

Shinmyoumaru:
A mask youkai. I don't know much either, but she's a kind of tsukumogami.

Tenshi:
A tsukumogami, huh? Another crass peasant then.

Kokoro:
Who?

Doremy:
She's a celestial. She hasn't been down here recently because she was under house arrest in Heaven, but now she's been banished.

Tenshi:
Wha- How do you know that?!

Doremy:
Because you're always whining about it in the Dream World.

Tenshi:
Dream World?! Just what are you?

Doremy:
I am Doremy Sweet, the ruler of dreams.
And this is the Dream World's Hata no Kokoro.

Kokoro:
This person has only ugly feelings. I can't picture her being a resident of Heaven.
I can't accept the existence of such an ugly person with feelings like that!

Kokoro:
Just die already!

Kokoro:
I'm sure you were spoiled as a child. You have no control over your emotions.

Tenshi:
You said you were from the Dream World? You sure bark a lot for toothless mutts.

Shinmyoumaru:
I've never seen this one before! Are you really the ruler of dreams?!

Doremy:
Yes, of course.

Shinmyoumaru:
Then, about what you said before... Is it true that she was banished from Heaven?

Doremy:
She's right here. Why not ask her yourself?

Tenshi:
Well, it's true I was banished. But it was for such a ridiculous reason.
As a natural-born celestial, destined for greatness from birth, why should I have to work?
And all I did was eat some disgusting elixir they were using in the great hall when I was on break.
Said I was "getting in the way." So they kicked me out until they finish preparing for the event. Isn't that ridiculous?

Shinmyoumaru:
Ah... yeah. I-Is that really ridiculous?

Kokoro:
I don't understand why you think that's ridiculous.

Tenshi:
What? But I'm important, right? I can't believe they got mad at me.

Shinmyoumaru:
Um... well... At least I understand why they call you a delinquent celestial now.

Tenshi:
Hm? Look! What's that?

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
We're gonna be the ultimate pair!

Sumireko:
I finally caught my beloved inchling! This combo will live on in legend!

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
Hee hee hee. I never thought pairing up with an outsider would work so well!

Shinmyoumaru:
What?! Who're you?!

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
Huh?! Who're YOU?!

Tenshi:
Another inchling?!

Sumireko:
Wha? Two inchings...? Is it a doppelganger?

Shinmyoumaru:
It's a fake! Get her!

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
You're the fake! Like I could lose!

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
I'm the one and only Shinmyoumaru Sukuna! Probably.

Shinmyoumaru:
Yay, we won! I'm the one and only Shinmyoumaru Sukuna!

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
That's weird... It wasn't supposed to go like this...

Tenshi:
Why are there two Shinmyoumarus...?

Sumireko:
One of 'em must be a doppelganger. Or maybe from the Dream World?
I had the same thing, so I know the feeling. It's confusing even as the original.

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
I'm the real one!

Shinmyoumaru:
No, I am! What are you talking about?!

Tenshi:
Eh, does it really matter? Let's keep going, partner!

Shinmyoumaru:
Aye aye, sir!

Shinmyoumaru (opponent):
Huh? I feel like I used to be in that role...

Shinmyoumaru:
Tee hee. Of course you weren't, faker!

Kasen:
You must be the infamous celestial.

Tenshi:
I am! Feel free to prostrate yourself.

Shinmyoumaru:
She's the hermit who lives on the mountain! I don't know if she's lonely or what, but she's always at the shrine.

Tenshi:
A hermit, huh? Doing that whole ascetic thing every day?

Kasen:
I am. And I don't need you to remind me.

Mamizou:
What, so this is the celestial? She's so short! Is this team shortie?

Kasen:
Even so, she's still a celestial.
Although I do believe that I'll be taking her seat sooner or later.

Tenshi:
Hmph! What was that about being an ascetic?
Your whole body is just bursting with luxury!
Take this as a warning from a celestial, when the glow wears off, you might as well be trash!

Kasen:
Ha! What kind of advice from a celestial leaves so little impression?!
I'll return those words right back at you!
When you throw away the light of Heaven, it becomes garbage!

Kasen:
So there are celestials as vulgar as her then?

Tenshi:
Weak! Too weak! Don't even think of ascending to Heaven like that!

Kasen:
So even a rotten celestial is still a celestial, is it? It's true that I'm lacking in my training.

Shinmyoumaru:
Tee hee, we did it!
The hermit and the tanuki are the real deal, even for Gensokyo!
At this point, it's no exaggeration to say we're the strongest!

Tenshi:
You... hasn't your tone changed since we first met?

Shinmyoumaru:
Eek! No, of course... not. I think.

Tenshi:
Well, fine.
But obviously I'd be the strongest on Earth.
Alright! Might as well rule the Earth until they let me back into Heaven!

Shinmyoumaru:
Sounds great! That's my celestial!
You think on a totally different scale!

Yukari:
Are you used to being a slave yet?

Reimu:
More or less.

Yukari:
The fate of our plan to capture the poverty/plague combo rests on how much you've trained. It's just...

Reimu:
Just...?

Yukari:
I think there's one more thing we need to make this plan foolproof.

Tenshi:
Hm? It's that youkai from back then!

Yukari:
Oh, what are you doing on the surface?

Tenshi:
Oh yeah, she was still around.
I can't rule the Earth until I beat her!

Yukari:
Why do you have to appear now with such bad timing?
I have no interest in you. Begone!

Shinmyoumaru:
This is that famous youkai with a parade of cheap tricks! Don't get careless!

Yukari:
Hm? That inchling... isn't the usual one.

Shinmyoumaru:
Tee hee! You got me! Right, I'm the Dream World Shinmyoumaru!
I forcibly possessed her in the confusion!

Tenshi:
Wait, what? You're not Shinmyoumaru?

Shinmyoumaru:
I'm Shinymoumaru, but not that Shinmyoumaru. I'm the Dream Shinmyoumaru.
You seemed funner, so I switched during the battle back there.

Tenshi:
Oh really? You can do stuff like that? Well, as long as you're powering me up I don't give a damn.

Yukari:
She switched slaves in the middle of the fight? That's the same power the plague god had...
Of course! So that's how it is! I've figured out how her power works!

Tenshi:
Stop muttering to yourself and fight me! I'm gonna be the ruler of Gensokyo!

Tenshi:
Apparently your mind is somewhere else. Who is your true opponent?

Yukari:
Thanks to you, I might've just found the last piece to defeat that duo.
Perfect Possession is no more. And slaves are now freed!

Yukari:
You've accidentally given me exactly what I needed. Now we can win.

Joon:
I'm looking forward to tonight's concert too! We'll take as much as we want from this audience!

Shion:
Hey, Joon, isn't it about time you gave me my cut?

Joon:
What? But if I gave it to you, you'd just lose it right away. Let me handle the cash.

Shion:
But you just spend it all right away! Either way it never gets to me!

Joon:
If we run out then we just take more. That's what it means to have a fountain of wealth.

Shion:
Well, I guess. Let's rake it in tonight.

Joon:
Ah, someone showed up.

Yukari:
That's far enough.
Poverty god Shion and plague god Joon, this mischief has gone on a little too long.

Joon:
What's with you? The concert's about to start, so stay out of our way.

Yukari:
Hee hee. I'm so giddy. I finally get to punish you two.

Joon:
Geez, what's your problem? Fine fine, we're the masterminds of the Perfect Possession Incident.
I'm sure you've heard the rumors that it's completely impossible to beat us?

Yukari:
But you never know until you try, right?
I'm plenty strong by myself, but I brought the ultimate supporter.
Once it's her turn, the incident is as good as resolved.

Shion:
Hey, Joon. The small fry just keeps going on and on. It just never ends. Is this my bad luck?

Joon:
It's so pitiful I can't bear to watch. Doesn't seem like she even has any luck for me to drain.

Joon:
Maybe you'd be happier slipping into the crowd and then, I dunno, dropping dead?

Yukari:
Ha... People born to be hated like you don't know even know what true happiness is.
You've never known happiness, so your personalities have become twisted.
But rejoice!
I'll grant you the happiness they call a total loss.
What joy!
It's time to begin the special concert that will change your lives!

Shion:
Okay, now she's too pitiful for me to watch either.

Joon:
Tee hee hee. Just from how you talk, I'm guessing you have some skill.
But it's right about time for playtime to end!

Yukari:
It's coming... Are you ready, Reimu?

Reimu:
I still don't quite get it, but leave it to me!

Joon:
Now's when your fate is sealed! Your loss is decided!

Joon & Shion:
Possession Exchange "Absolute Loser"

Shion:
All right, you're possessed! Now Joon's victory is assured!
...Wait, Joon? Where'd you go?

Reimu:
Oh... so that's what it was.
Yukari's explanation gave me no clue what was going to happen.

Shion:
Y-You! How are you moving freely?!
You were supposed to become Joon's slave and have your freedom taken away...

Reimu:
True, you have the power to guarantee defeat for anyone you possess...
And your sister, the plague god, can switch slaves, forcing you on someone else...
In other words, you can force defeat on any opponent. Absolutely.
You really are the worst, most disastrous combo.
But you were no match for two truly strong people.

Shion:
You were supposed to lose control of your body when you possessed Joon...
But how?! How are you still moving?

Reimu:
Look closely. You're the master now.

Shion:
Eh?

Reimu:
And I'm a master too. Yukari flipped the border of master and slave.
So the partners who were switched were Yukari and your sister.

Joon:
Crap! It was a trap!
I'm the enemy's slave now!

Shion:
What?!
So I'm not possessing Yukari then...? Wait, then my slave must be-

Yukari:
Right answer! Like this, both your power as a poverty god and her power as a plague god are meaningless.
Now Reimu, I won't be able to offer you any more assistance. Take care of this poverty god.

Shion:
They switched the master and slave? They can do that? There's someone who can do that?!

Joon:
Ah, we're done for! There's no way you can win on your own, sis!
You're totally useless in battle! You're just a gloomy, poor, smelly, miser who can't do anything on your own!
All you ever do is complain! There's not a single good thing about you! And now you're on your own!
I mean, you're a god of poverty who's never experienced victory even once.
In a one-on-one fight with the goddamned incident-resolving shrine maiden!?
It's over! We lost!

Reimu:
Okay okay, that's enough of the harsh farewell.
Now, all I have to do is beat this small fry poverty god whose only power is to make people lose.

Shion:
Joon... All of you...
Even if everyone's always looking down on me, you didn't have to go that far!

Shion:
My name is Shion Yorigami!
I'm a poverty god who brings bad luck even to crying children!

Reimu:
Wh-What an incredible negative aura!

Shion:
I've never been serious about this until now.
If I let it all out, everyone will be unfortunate, including me!
But I've had enough. Who cares about winning or losing?
When I'm done here, we'll all be losers.
The shrine maiden, me, and you too, Joon!

Reimu:
This negative aura makes the plague god seem like nothing!
Did our plan fail when we put the poverty god in center stage?!

Shion:
No one wins. No one finds happiness.
I'll show you a world where we all suffer together!

Reimu:
If I get swallowed up by this, I'll lose for no reason!
Pull yourself together! I'm the incident-resolving shrine maiden!

Shion:
The plague and poverty gods were the worst, most disastrous combo?
Don't make me laugh!
I was the worst and most disastrous all on my own! I am the god of poverty, Shion Yorigami!
Die cowering before poverty!

Shion:
Uwaaa!

Reimu:
What is this! Suddenly the atmosphere turns different!

Shion:
...The auras I've been retaining, they're all flowing out!

Reimu:
So you've been covering that glaring aura under your negative ones all along!

Shion:
I don't care anymore! I'm going all-in with every aura I have!

Reimu:
By your grace, my power is flowing like the endless tide!
Now the victory is in my hands! Just like what I thought, you lost to your own ability!

Joon:
I can't believe perfect possession was screwing up the Dream World. Did you know that, Shion?

Shion:
Well, I kinda realized.
When I'm possessing someone I usually pass through the Dream World.
So it sounds like perfect possession works the same way.

Joon:
C'mon, you gotta tell me this stuff!
Thanks to that, now we have to go through this whole pain in the rear.

Marisa:
Found ya!
You two! You'll pay for what you've done!

Joon:
The human magician... So which one are you?

Shion:
Hmm. I still can't tell which one she is.

Marisa:
Which one? What's that supposed to mean?

Joon:
We're wondering if you're the real one or the Dream World one.
You see, we were told to go capture all the Dream World residents going wild all over the place.
They're supposed to look exactly the same, but they told us that the dream versions always say exactly what they're thinking. Supposedly their emotions aren't the stablest, either.

Marisa:
Oho. So you're hunting the dream selves, huh?
Did Reimu or Yukari put you up to this? I hate how they're always stealing the main character-ish role from me.
And now that I finally got the chance to run free in the real world, you two clowns are tryin' to catch me?!
I'm gonna test out my berserk magic as much as I want!

Joon:
Found one! Kill! This is the Dream World Marisa!

Marisa:
Wait, my real self couldn't beat these weaklings?

Joon:
That's one down! Let's just hand her over to Yukari.

Marisa:
Crap! I wanted to run wild more!

Shion:
Okay, let's keep this up and find the rampaging dream selves.

Mamizou:
Oho? So you're saying I'm the dream version?

Joon:
Rumor has it that the chief of the tanuki has been acting funny.

Mamizou:
So you figured it out. Indeed, I'm the dream me.
But acting funny? That's ridiculous.
The real me is just too cautious around everyone. She's the one who's acting funny.
Why the heck should I need to hold back in this tiny, cramped world?
All I'm saying is that we can get rid of everyone who won't obey me and create my ideal Gensokyo!

Shion:
Indeed. That definitely sounds like a dream version. Thank you kindly, ma'am.
I wonder why all these dream selves have all this baseless self-confidence.

Mamizou:
Ho ho ho! Baseless, you say?
Why don't you see for yourselves if it's baseless?!
I'm the chief of the bakedanuki! I'll transform you straight to dead!

Mamizou:
I think I'll make Gensokyo my summer home. Then I'll go get what I really want: the mainland!

Joon:
Ha! An ideal Gensokyo? With that level of skill, you'd be lucky to be the boss of a mountain.

Mamizou:
Ugh... I just didn't get enough sleep last night.

Shion:
But anyway, got another dream self! We're on a roll!

Joon:
I can't believe things are going so great when you're with me, Sis. It's like a dream.

Shion:
I never wanted such a terrible sister, you know.

Miko:
Oh? So you two have come to greet your own deaths? Obviously, I won't let it be painless.

Joon:
That turned violent quick.

Shion:
But with just that, I still can't tell if it's the dream version or not.
Maybe she's always like this?

Miko:
I see poverty dulls the wits. Your existence is a blight upon the world.
Allow me to extinguish you, here and now.

Joon:
What an exclusory bastard. Whatever happened to "hold harmony sacred"?!

Shion:
I think this is the dream version, but at this point, I don't even care!
She's going down!

Miko:
People like you, who are poor from the depths of your hearts, wouldn't know harmony if you saw it!
Disappear from this world!

Miko:
The real me is soft. She should flaunt her power more.

Joon:
So she was the dream one after all! All right, that's another one!

Miko:
How frustrating. No doubt the real me intends to let you live.
My only regret is that I was unable to rid the world of this evil.

Shion:
Yeah yeah. You really hate us, don't you?
But eh, we're used to it.

Miko:
I hold no hatred for you. But some things simply cannot be allowed to exist. That duty drives me.
That is Gensokyo's harmony.

Byakuren:
So have you finished cleaning the garden, Joon?

Joon:
Bleh! You think I'd ever do anything as uptight as cleaning the temple?!

Byakuren:
So you're escaping then? Then I'll have to annihilate you.

Joon:
Ha? Annihilate? I'd like to see you try!

Byakuren:
You hadn't noticed? There's an annihilation bomb implanted in your skull.

Joon:
Hm? Annihilation bomb? What?

Byakuren:
It's activated when I speak the incantation. I insisted on it, just in case you resisted.

Joon:
Wha? Y-You're joking...

Shion:
I can't tell if she's lying. What do we do?

Joon:
Isn't it obvious?!
We keep up the attack so she can't chant the spell!

Byakuren:
Just kidding! Not that it wouldn't be simpler if there really were a bomb.

Joon:
Whaaaat? So this was just the dream version?
So that bomb was a lie, right? You scared me for a second there.

Byakuren:
Oh, you realized. I just thought, "wouldn't it be nice if there were a spell to easily remove people I don't like..."

Joon:
You sure think lazy thoughts for someone who makes other people do so much work.

Byakuren:
There's nothing wrong with wanting an easier life. If I could attain enlightenment without training, nothing would please me more.
Incidentally, don't leave please.
I make the disciples do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry by telling them it's for their training. It's to make my life easier.

Joon:
Is this really how that bum priest thinks?
...Weird. Suddenly I feel a deep connection with her.
Maybe I'll stick around at the temple a little longer.

Shion:
J-Joon?!

Kasen:
The worst, most disastrous pair, is it?
Ever since your identities came to light, it's no exaggeration to say you're Gensokyo's most hated people. You're so popular.

Joon:
Yeah yeah, we're fine, thanks for asking. It's always been tough for us, so we're used to being hated.

Kasen:
This was Yukari's order, correct? That's why you're here?

Joon:
Yeah, she told us that there were dream people all over Gensokyo.
Said she'd let us off the hook for the Perfect Possession Incident if we caught them all.

Kasen:
You're being deceived.
She may put on airs of being a big-shot, but deep inside she's nothing but a coward. That calm face she puts on is just a mask.
She'd never leave a disruptive element alone, but she's too scared to take action herself. That's the sort of person she is.
She didn't want to fight the dream people.
She didn't want to fight you two either.
Didn't she only ask you to do this hoping you'd both destroy each other?

Joon:
That's... That does make sense.

Kasen:
So, with that in mind, I'd like to discuss something.

Kasen:
Won't you ally with the dream dwellers and rule Gensokyo together?

Joon:
Ally?!

Kasen:
As long as the Perfect Possession Incident continues, you two can become more powerful. Isn't it such a waste to let it end?
Join us, and the dream dwellers will do everything in our power to keep it going.

Shion:
Don't be fooled! She's just saying this because she wants to come out into the real world!
Don't listen to this dream dwellers's sweet words!

Joon:
I don't need you to tell me that, Shion! But...

Kasen:
As long as the perfect possessions continue, you two will undoubtedly be the strongest. Why hesitate?

Joon:
True, perfect possession was pretty much made for us, but...
No! I'm not that person anymore!
I threw away the life that dresses up in other people's money! I want to live an emotionally fulfilling life!

Shion:
What. What happened to you, Joon?
I mean, I still want to dress up nice, even if I have to use other people's money...

Joon:
Shut up, Shion.
Things like money and gems didn't bring me happiness.
I've said farewell to the past me, in order to find true happiness!

Joon:
You're the one trying to trick me, you dream bastard!

Kasen:
Tsk!
I'd heard they were making you train at the temple, but this was their goal?
Then I don't need you! I'll banish you from Gensokyo forever!

Kasen:
The day when dreams rule Gensokyo approaches.

Joon:
We won! Got the dream person!

Shion:
Hey, Joon? Did you really mean what you said just now?

Joon:
Who knows? Maybe it's 'cause of that training at the temple?
It just feels like money and gems glitter less than they used to.

Kasen:
Do you two intend to capture every last dream dweller?

Joon:
That's the plan. Well, it was the plan. We're already done, I guess?
We heard from Yukari that you might be the last one.
Finally free of this penance!

Kasen:
I'm the last one?
That's not true. The worst, most disastrous hooligan of the dream world remains.

Joon:
Worst, most disastrous?
Hearing someone else called that doesn't sit well with me at all.

Kasen:
Would you like meet this worst, most disastrous dream dweller?

Joon:
Of course!
If there's anything in this world that could scare me, I'd love to see it!

Kasen:
What nerve!
I like it! Now I understand why the real me accepted you two.

Shion:
So where is this worst, most disastrous person?

Kasen:
In space! If you want to catch her, then fly! To the limitless heights of the sky!

Tenshi:
Ahahaha!
I can't believe the fools banished me! Me!
I fear nothing! Let those fools in their tedious Heaven break!
Who's there?

Joon:
So it's you, huh? The worst, most disastrous dream hooligan.

Tenshi:
Hm? Who are you two?

Joon:
I'm Joon Yorigami, the plague god who'll swindle even crying children.

Shion:
And I'm Shion Yorigami, the poverty god who'll ruin even crying children.
We're the ones who caused the Perfect Possession Incident.
You're from the Dream World, right?

Tenshi:
The Perfect Possession Incident?!
I see, then you're the ones who set me free! You have my thanks!

Tenshi:
I am Tenshi Hinanawi, the celestial who'll ascend even crying children! Bow before me!

Joon:
Uh, this is bad. Really bad.
What's with this ridiculous power that's shaking even the heavens? I've never felt anything like it.

Shion:
Calm down, Joon. It's just the suppressed dream power running wild.
She shouldn't be able to keep it up for long.

Tenshi:
Hmph! Fools! I use the temperament of all mankind! This power is inexhaustible!

Joon:
Inexhaustible?! Got any other bright ideas?

Shion:
I can't believe I have to get serious again.
I am the god of poverty. I carry the misfortune of all mankind! This negative aura is inexhaustible!

Tenshi:
Negative aura? But you're right, this is cruel. Too cruel...

Joon:
Aw, my poor poor sister.
But one I can always count on! This is over! The worst, most disastrous sister can handle this on her own!
You! The rampaging celestial! You think you can match Shion's misfortune?!

Tenshi:
If I approach carelessly, I might get swallowed up by all that misfortune...
Hmph! Then I just have to beat you without getting close!

Tenshi:
Witness the fighting style of someone who lives in the sky! A celestial!
Once I beat you two,
I'll destroy Heaven,
destroy the Earth,
destroy humanity,
tame the land,
make four beautiful seasons,
create new life,
give them hearts that never feel sad,
build a society where no one's poor...
I'll remake this entire world!
Rot in death! You heretic gods!

Tenshi:
Ah ha ha! This is the birth of a new world!

Joon:
We did it!

Shion:
We finally captured all dream dwellers!

Joon:
There's something weird about her... And she wasn't as strong as I thought she was.

Tenshi:
Hmhmhm.
Don't think this is over!
What you will see, is the tactic that only celestials would think of!
Drop your earthlings' common sense! Witness the true meaning of dogfight!
The duo of vile goddesses! Unchain yourself from the bind of earth, and derail like space debris, just like how you strayed from morals!

Reimu:
Am I getting possessed too much? I'm starting to see myself...

Reimu:
Leave the incident solving to me! You'd better just stay as an obedient slave.

Reimu:
Wasn't that nyuudou your only slave?

Reimu:
I heard you were investigating to resolve this incident as well? You're interfering with my business.

Reimu:
Are you... actually getting dumber?

Reimu:
Yeah, yeah, sure, another rival of incident solving...

Reimu:
This incident... I wonder if it could be caused by mechanical means.

Reimu:
Dunno if it's because of perfect possession, but I can clearly recognize you.

Reimu:
So that was perfect possession? I thought you had just disguised yourself.

Reimu:
It's been a while since then, but you're as expressionless as ever.

Reimu:
That injury on your arm... Is it ever going to get better?

Reimu:
Come to think of it, I've heard rumors about people finding glowing bamboo...

Reimu:
Aww. I thought the one who perfect possessed you was hiding in that bowl all the time.

Reimu:
What's the difference between ESP and sleight of hand?

Reimu:
You're really used to serving people, so it seems you're not so good at handling your own slave.

Reimu:
That jelly-ish thing you are holding... What IS that exactly?

Reimu:
Long time no see. I wonder if you've made a lot of trouble back in Heaven as well.

Reimu:
Because of all this perfect possession I'd forgotten about urban legends, but... Really, what IS your urban legend all about?

Reimu:
This Perfect Possession Incident is seriously getting on my nerves.

Reimu:
Hey, you look rich. Wanna do some business with me?

Reimu:
By the way... You're already a team of two, but you can perfect possess on top of that. Isn't that a little weird?

Reimu:
I probably could've won all on my own, though.

Reimu:
Oh dear... This incident is so fun... No no no, I need to resolve it..

Reimu:
Surprisingly, we hardly ever team up and fight together, do we, Marisa?
Depending on how hard we practice, maybe we could become the strongest duo.

Marisa:
Incidents this interesting are pretty rare. I'll look into it for you.

Marisa:
By the way,
Why are the Prismrivers' concerts so popular all of a sudden?

Marisa:
Wh-why is there another me?

Marisa:
You were a tag team to begin with, weren'tcha? Always thought of it as a handicap, personally.

Marisa:
Seems like your following is steadily growing. Compared to the Hakurei Shrine, business is booming at Myouren Temple.

Marisa:
Are you done with your dishwashing job?

Marisa:
Since you're so egoistic, wouldn't you be stronger on your own?

Marisa:
I'm surprised an engineer like you is able to utilize an unscientific incident like this.

Marisa:
By the time I noticed, I'd already won. You're as mysterious as ever.

Marisa:
I'm curious... It feels like you could easily light your tail on fire with your pipe.

Marisa:
I think you'd fit better on the possessing side, as a slave, y'know.

Marisa:
The animals get all confused, you know. When their master gets perfect possessed.

Marisa:
Weren't you possessed by a phoenix in the past?

Marisa:
So you can still properly do perfect possession even if you're small, huh.

Marisa:
That thing you're holding looks pretty expensive. Although there are some cracks on it.

Marisa:
Don't tell me this Perfect Possession Incident comes from lunar technology?

Marisa:
Is it a rule of yours to never cut your hair?

Marisa:
What are you doing on Earth?

Marisa:
It had been peaceful recently since you weren't showing up.

Marisa:
Wow, you seem like the extravagant type.

Marisa:
Uwah! Poverty god! Run away!

Marisa:
They call it "possession", but it's a little different from someone taking over your body.

Marisa:
Yay, we did it! You're a little hard to handle, Koishi... But you're probably the best at being a slave that messes around with others.

Ichirin:
This incident sure is interesting. Can't we just play a bit more like this?

Ichirin:
Looks like you're no good at dealing with these tricky fighting styles.

Ichirin:
Nope. My voice just doesn't reach Unzan when I switch places by possession.

Ichirin:
Won't you please appoint me to be your slave?

Ichirin:
Hey, I'm much better at dealing with you as a slave.

Ichirin:
To think I'd see the day you and Master Hijiri would stop fighting... I'm impressed.

Ichirin:
With all due respect, I would like to give some advice.
Your bedhead is terrible today. I think you'd look much cooler if you took care of it.

Ichirin:
Wait, your perfect possession partner... Are you sure you're not just brainwashing them with that machine?

Ichirin:
There's a difference between "being free of thought" and "not thinking anything". That's what Master Hijiri said.

Ichirin:
Carrying liquor to the battlefield... You must really like drinking.

Ichirin:
Though it looks like you've gotten more emotional, your expressions are still blank.

Ichirin:
Does mist taste good?

Ichirin:
I thought you wanted to die, but it seems like you're having a lot of fun. Good for you.

Ichirin:
Your inchling mind is as small as your body!

Ichirin:
In Buddhism, those who boast of their powers are people without virtue.

Ichirin:
Your danmaku is pretty unsettling. I don't get anyone who'd want to team up with you.

Ichirin:
I'm getting sleepy just looking at you...

Ichirin:
What? You can actually eat those peaches on your head?

Ichirin:
The boundary between a nyuudou and an umibouzu? Isn't that the coastline?

Ichirin:
You should not be spending your money on such showy things. That's what Master Hijiri said.

Ichirin:
That beggar-ish look... Are you perhaps aiming to be a mendicant?

Ichirin:
Phew! That feels good! Nothing's better than a good duel!

Ichirin:
You know, Unzan, it'd be nice if you could just move on your own when I'm swapped out.

Ichirin:
It makes me a little nervous having Master Hijiri as my slave. But it's also a bit nice.

Byakuren:
I'll be the one to solve the incident this time.

Byakuren:
Would you like to train at the temple? I'm sure you'll grow stronger there.

Byakuren:
All right, that's it for today's match. I'll leave you in charge of the laundry and the cooking.

Byakuren:
I'd like someone stronger as a practice opponent.
Do you happen to know where Nue has gone?

Byakuren:
There are two of me... Is this also caused by the incident?

Byakuren:
You've been playing with our Ichirin this whole time, haven't you? Thanks.

Byakuren:
Let's work hard together to resolve this Perfect Possession Incident.

Byakuren:
I made some dango as a substitute for shirikodama. Enjoy.

Byakuren:
Your sister sometime visits our temple just to look for you.

Byakuren:
Apparently the tea kettle of Morin Temple was for sale at the bazaar, if you're interested.

Byakuren:
Your expressions are still stiff, aren't they.

Byakuren:
There are lots of different hermits, aren't there.

Byakuren:
You seem to be pretty lively. Well, good for you, I guess?

Byakuren:
Oh no, what a waste. I accidentally damaged your bowl.

Byakuren:
Even an outsider is using perfect possession, I see.

Byakuren:
So her name is Sagume Kishin. The culprit behind the Urban Legend Incident.

Byakuren:
The Dream World...? Are you referring to a world within your mind?

Byakuren:
So you were a celestial? You're a lot more vulgar than I expected.

Byakuren:
Sometimes here, sometimes there... What a flashy way of fighting.

Byakuren:
A simple lifestyle is a good one, you know.

Byakuren:
You are still in lack of devotion.

Byakuren:
Oh, my slave and I are both the body-strengthening type.
Teaming up with you seems to work rather well, Mokou.

Futo:
Art thou all right? I haven't heard a whit of good news about the shrine of late.

Futo:
Thou hast increased thine firepower. Quite a task, given thy water affinity.

Futo:
Let's play again.

Futo:
Come to think of it,
some people called the Prismriver Troupe are holding something called a concert. Would you like to see it with me?

Futo:
Even on thy own, thou art powerful enough. If thou teamed up with the Crown Prince, wouldn't that be the strongest team?

Futo:
Oh? Thou face look just like me.

Futo:
My deepest appreciation for this Perfect Possession training battle.

Futo:
Hast though considered opening a shop within the Divine Spirit Mausoleum?

Futo:
The Underworld is great. Hot springs, everywhere.

Futo:
What's the difference between a tanuki and a mami?

Futo:
I might like to wear that mask of thine...

Futo:
I might like to study those animal controlling hermit arts.

Futo:
Immortality is the ultimate hermit art. Oh how I envy thou.

Futo:
Upon consideration, even this cheeky inchling is adorable.

Futo:
What is this Instagram? Did seeing me break my plates give thou some kind of idea?

Futo:
What a peculiar trumpet. What use does it have?

Futo:
I've gotten a little sleepy...

Futo:
I'd heard that heaven is riddled with eccentric celestials. So it was true.

Futo:
So what's on the other side of thy gap?

Futo:
Such a reckless spender. I dobut thou hast much savings.

Futo:
It'd be best to carry amber on thyself, to bring luck with money.

Futo:
A fight like this is just a waste of plates.

Futo:
Why Kappa slave, with my plates and thine,
we are a veritable plate combination.
And surprisingly, perhaps the strongest?

Miko:
I shall be the one to resolve the Perfect Possession Incident!

Miko:
You've always shown promise. How about it? Won't you become my slave?

Miko:
You're too reliant on your nyuudou. How about this? If you train by my side, you can become stronger.

Miko:
To be honest, the difficulty of resolving this incident is at its limits.

Miko:
You... Recently, it feels like you've become a bit vulgar.

Miko:
Hmm, how did I end up fighting myself?

Miko:
Don't tell me...
That rumor that's been going around...
Could this be the dream version of me?

Miko:
You can analyze perfect possession with machines!?

Miko:
If you wish, shall I force that third eye of yours open?

Miko:
You, like me, have a way with words, but you don't have the strength to back them up. That's what makes you different from me.

Miko:
You break your masks rather quickly, don't you.

Miko:
You're quite an unusual person. Even though you're a hermit, why do you feel the need to broadcast the aura of just a normal person?

Miko:
If you really are immortal, I feel like you could live your life a little more wisely.

Miko:
Why don't you retrain yourself by my side? You possess a power that exceeds your physical capabilities.

Miko:
Oh, so the period I lived in is called the Asuka period. It has a nice ring to it.

Miko:
At some point, we shall have to settle things with the Lunarians.

Miko:
That's right, the Perfect Possession Incident occurred due to the Urban Legend Incident.
Tell me everything you know about this person named Sagume Kishin.

Miko:
To think something like the Dream World would actually exist.

Miko:
If you really are a celestial, then answer me this. What more do I need now in order to reach Heaven?

Miko:
It seems like you're about to grasp some vital information regarding the Perfect Possession Incident.

Miko:
It's frustrating, but I understand the feeling. Humans are always quick to support the flashiest one among them.

Miko:
The poor will err in their judgment. I shall forgive you, if only for a bit.

Miko:
If you wish to become my slave, feel free to say so at any time!

Miko:
A hermit team is not bad at all.
Though it may look different on the outside, our hermit arts come from the same roots,
so we're rather compatible.

Nitori:
Can you hold off on resolving the incident just a little longer? I'm in the middle of my analysis.

Nitori:
Ohoo, with that firepower of yours, you'd make a great slave for me.

Nitori:
Come to think of it, haven't you always had a tag partner? Who allowed that?

Nitori:
On top of the shrine maiden, you're also trying to resolve the incident? I'd better hurry.

Nitori:
Look all these plates you wasted! Don't you know eco is the trend now? ECO-friendly not EGO!

Nitori:
On top of the shrine maiden, you're also trying to resolve the incident? I'd better hurry.

Nitori:
Yesss, simulation complete! Artificial Perfect Possession is almost in reach!

Nitori:
I have no idea what you're thinking, but you make a valuable sample.

Nitori:
I'm thirsty. Give me whatever you have dangling from your back!

Nitori:
You are an indispensable part of our perfect possession study. I'm counting on you.

Nitori:
The reason for emotions being shared...
It's possible that there is some influence from the Dream World. In that case, there's nothing we can do.

Nitori:
The kappa's nostrum works, you know? Want me to put some on your arm?

Nitori:
My machines are flammable, you know.

Nitori:
There is no bowl that can stand against my crowbar!

Nitori:
That thing you're holding looks like some delicate machinery. Although there are some cracks on it.

Nitori:
The way you are right now, there's no way that this is the lunar technology you're always going on about.

Nitori:
You're from the Dream World? I'm surprised. Looks like there are still many mysteries left to be discovered.

Nitori:
Oh, it's been a while since I've seen you. Are you back to cause a huge disturbance again?

Nitori:
I didn't expect you to be interested in artifical perfect possession, too.

Nitori:
This crowbar I'm holding is from the best brand of crowbars. How about adding it to your collection?

Nitori:
If I sell things to someone who I know is paying with stolen money... Well, that's not the same as buying stolen goods at all.

Nitori:
Alright! Great data! Just a bit more until Perfect Possession Energy analysis is complete!

Nitori:
A mix of water and fire... Sounds like an amazing combination. But I doubt if we'll ever get along with each other...

Koishi:
Perfect possession is an incident, but since it's fun, isn't it okay if you don't resolve it?

Koishi:
Hello~ Are you using magic~?

Koishi:
I'm always watching you when you train~ Drinking tea and basking in the sun is Myouren Temple's way of training, right?

Koishi:
Question~! What's the difference between "satori" in Buddhism and my sister?

Koishi:
In terms of feng shui, what's it like underground?

Koishi:
My sister said she wanted to meet you. She said she wanted to read the mind of someone who acts so self-important.

Koishi:
What's that key you have on your chest?

Koishi:
I won against myself!

Koishi:
When you throw out the ashes from that pipe, you've definitely burned your tail before, haven't you~

Koishi:
If you're happy that you lost, then you should just smile~

Koishi:
My sister is also loved by nothing but animals, so are you hated by humans, too?

Koishi:
Do you really not die? I want to test it out~!

Koishi:
Aren't you a little bigger than before? Ah, I meant the size of your heart.

Koishi:
I heard you can bend spoons~? Although I'm not really sure if that's supposed to be amazing.

Koishi:
Rabbits die when they get too lonely, right? Good thing we have perfect possession!

Koishi:
If you were going to get a custom-made hat, you could've just cut your hair.

Koishi:
So Heaven is between the Earth and the Moon. Maybe I'll go visit!

Koishi:
Sorry~For winning so easily.

Koishi:
By the way, my sister said something.
She had a premonition that things were going to get busy on the surface. I wonder if the power struggles are going to get worse?

Koishi:
Aah, I keep unconsciously spending my money!

Koishi:
Maybe I'll try possessing you next~

Koishi:
Surprisingly, you and I seem to have some similar powers.
Maybe we'll make a good pair?

Mamizou:
It's 'cause you're the lone wolf type. No surprise you can't get the hang of Perfect Possession.

Mamizou:
Magic is a wicked thing, kid. If you're gonna keep usin' it as a human, then watch yourself.

Mamizou:
So you've got the Nyuudou, and Perfect Possession on top of that? Leave a little for everyone else, why don'tcha?

Mamizou:
I hear you can find good deals on temple stuff at the Kappa Bazaar.

Mamizou:
Ain'tcha gettin' a mite TOO used to modern society?

Mamizou:
Yer trying to resolve the Perfect Possession incident too, ya say? That could be fun too.

Mamizou:
Just this once, this incident isn't good for business.

Mamizou:
Your slave is one of my tanuki spies. We lost sight of ya right way, so I stuck 'em in ya so it won't happen again.

Mamizou:
The heck? Who would transform inta me?

Mamizou:
Yer face is stiff as death under those masks. Shouldn't ya try expression training or somethin'?

Mamizou:
Hey, how's about a drinking contest? This time, fair 'n square.

Mamizou:
If I were in yer shoes, I'd be makin' better use of it. Oh, I mean yer strength, not yer lifespan.

Mamizou:
Yer so small I nearly swallowed ya whole.

Mamizou:
...Oho, AI, eh? Humans are finally driving that last nail in the coffin for youkai then?

Mamizou:
So rabbits can't transform no matter hard they try?

Mamizou:
Ruler of dreams, eh? That the best ya can come up with? I don't buy it.

Mamizou:
I hear ya can be invincible if ya eat the flesh of a celestial.

Mamizou:
The "official" ruler of Gensokyo, eh?

Mamizou:
Those gems and brand names are fakes, yeah? Wait, they're the real deal?!

Mamizou:
Hey, that's close enough! Poverty spreads, ya know.

Mamizou:
Perfect Possession, eh? If ya can't use it well, then it's a double-edged sword.

Mamizou:
Your slave is one of my tanuki spies.

Mamizou:
Figured this slave would be powerful. You're the best, Mokou.

Kokoro:
Hey hey, I want to do a Noh performance at the shrine! Invite me over again!

Kokoro:
I never noticed before, but your magical starry sky is so pretty!

Kokoro:
Mister Nyuudou sure is big, huh? He's unpredictable, too.

Kokoro:
Wow, cool! Getting stronger by chanting? I want to be like you!

Kokoro:
Isn't that hat heeeeavy?

Kokoro:
I've been sooo overflowing with emotions lately, I'm getting fired up by even by the smallest of things! Every day's been fun!

Kokoro:
You could work on your fighting skills, but you're really good as business! I should learn from you!

Kokoro:
You look so happy even though you lost! It's a wonderful smile!

Kokoro:
Drinking and smoking in the middle of a fight? You're so mature!

Kokoro:
Hm? Another me? What expression was I supposed to show here again?

Kokoro:
The animals are so cute! They're all quiet, and I can't read their expressions.

Kokoro:
Not being able to die is amazing!

Kokoro:
I want to get in the bowl too! I want to be your slave!

Kokoro:
The lining of your cloak is so flashy!

Kokoro:
Is that a big trumpet you're holding? It looks like it can make some nice sounds!

Kokoro:
So why do emotions get many times stronger in the Dream World anyway?

Kokoro:
Huh? I could swear I've met you somewhere before...?
Oh, of course! I forgot that I'm the Hata no Kokoro of the Dream World!

Kokoro:
Seeing you with so much self-condifidence makes me me feel better too!

Kokoro:
That space on the other side of your gap is scary, but I want to take a peek...

Kokoro:
Wow, you look so rich! Buy me something, buy me something!

Kokoro:
Wow, you look so poor! Can't you borrow money from your rich sister?

Kokoro:
Yaay! Fighting is fuuuun!

Kokoro:
I'm Hata no Kokoro of the Dream World. I've been wanting to rampage in the real world!

Kasen:
The are too many mysteries to the Perfect Possession Incident. This will be difficult to resolve.

Kasen:
There are too many mysteries to this perfect possession incident It seems it would be difficult to solve.
The Moriya Shrine has that ropeway, but it was most likely planned alongside the Kappa and the Tengu.
At this rate, the Hakurei Shrine has no chance of commerical victory.

Kasen:
You've been well-behaved lately, haven't you? Even though your main occupation is thief.

Kasen:
Everyone always looks at the nyuudou behind you, instead of you, don't they? How pitiable.

Kasen:
So you've already begun your own investigation of the Perfect Possession Incident. But ordinary methods won't work here.

Kasen:
The way you fight by always coming after my weak point is marvelous. Although I did end up winning.

Kasen:
So you've already begun your own investigation of the Perfect Possession Incident. But ordinary methods won't work here.

Kasen:
You say you can can artificially reproduce Perfect Possession?!

Kasen:
How's your sister been? She does realize it's alright to come to the surface from time to time, right?

Kasen:
Should I borrow that gourd of limitless sake so we can have another drinking match?

Kasen:
I see you're full of emotions now, or should I say you've become rather lighthearted?

Kasen:
Could this be the dream me?!

Kasen:
At first glance you seem to be pushing through with pure force, but actually you have no wasted movements, don't you?

Kasen:
Your body is small, but your feelings have gotten large, huh?

Kasen:
I see. So the outside world is undergoing another major change.

Kasen:
Apparently, the Urban Legend Incident is the work of a Lunarian Is Eientei not going to take action?

Kasen:
The Dream World. So it really does exist.

Kasen:
I'm even more conflicted after seeing you. Should I aim to become a celestial or not?

Kasen:
As I thought, your methods are a little crude. A true sage will sometimes appear the fool to others.

Kasen:
I don't understand why I should give you anything.

Kasen:
If only you'd had grace in poverty.

Kasen:
Always keep a relaxed stance. That is the shortcut to being the strongest.

Kasen:
I see. Hermit arts are easier to perform when paired with another hermit. Or maybe that's just my imagination.

Mokou:
You don't have to solve this incident right away, you know. Isn't it fun?

Mokou:
We should partner up next time. Our ultimate firepower would fry any of our half-assed opponents!

Mokou:
The slave possessing you needs to chant a prayer too.

Mokou:
I was thinking about having a match of power against you.

Mokou:
Cheer up! It's completely natural for me to win, after all.

Mokou:
Even a big-shot like you ends up being nothing if you have a bad pairing.

Mokou:
Not even all that water can extinguish the flames of my resentment.

Mokou:
I'm sure there are lots of stronger foes underground, so why do I have to fight someone like this?

Mokou:
Those bold, but swift moves of yours... Aren't they a perfect match for me?

Mokou:
It's a little ominous when you can't read someone's emotions from their face.

Mokou:
I've lived much longer than sloppy hermits like you.

Mokou:
Tanuki chief, it's you, right? Enough with the practical jokes.

Mokou:
Even though you're small, you show a lot of promise. I had lots of fun.

Mokou:
If I perfect possess you, will I be able to go to the outside world?

Mokou:
You seem like you'd know something. So is this incident also the work of the Lunar Capital?

Mokou:
The ruler of dreams? There's no way I can believe all that kid stuff.

Mokou:
You like to mess around, but your power is the real deal. Were you talented from the start? You have some crazy power.

Mokou:
Celestials are also immortals, huh? Maybe that ridiculously casual mindset of yours is something to respect.

Mokou:
I always get a bad feeling whenever you show up.

Mokou:
What a creepy person.

Mokou:
The patches on my clothes aren't bills, you know?

Mokou:
I may not get what's causing this Perfect Possession thing, but it means I have twice the chance to go wild.

Mokou:
My fire and your fire seem to
be different kinds of fire, Marisa.
If our firepower doesn't go up when
we team up, there's no point.

Shinmyoumaru:
If I can win against a shrine maiden, I'll be the strongest!

Shinmyoumaru:
The bowl will protect me from the laser!

Shinmyoumaru:
A training monk is nothing!

Shinmyoumaru:
I defeated an armed monk! I'll keep you in mind as a potential partner.

Shinmyoumaru:
Does your head hurt? Maybe I hit too much.

Shinmyoumaru:
Alright, if I defeat you, I think I'll be the strongest.

Shinmyoumaru:
Aw man, my bowls are all wet because of your water!

Shinmyoumaru:
I even defeated a youkai from the Underworld! Strongest of the Underworld!

Shinmyoumaru:
A Tanuki Leader‚Ä¶‚Ä¶nah. I don't really want to work with you.

Shinmyoumaru:
I don't want to team up with this gross youkai.

Shinmyoumaru:
I defeated a hermit! Poke her in the eyes!

Shinmyoumaru:
Seems scary. I don't want to team up with her.

Shinmyoumaru:
An imposter! Kill it!

Shinmyoumaru:
Maybe it's ok to work with this one‚Ä¶‚Ä¶? Hmm... if I remember the past, I'm not so sure.

Shinmyoumaru:
I don't think I'll be strong teaming up with you.

Shinmyoumaru:
The Dream World? Like a magical world where I can meet a bigger me?

Shinmyoumaru:
What an aura! This person might be the best for me!

Shinmyoumaru:
No way, no way. I want to get away from this creepy person.

Shinmyoumaru:
I just know. I shouldn't get close to this guy.

Shinmyoumaru:
I just know. This is a bad guy.

Shinmyoumaru:
We won! Should I decide on this team then...?

Shinmyoumaru:
We won, but I think I'm best as the slave, huh?

Sumireko:
Whaat, you're not giving out seal stamps? You won't get popular that way!

Sumireko:
A witch riding a broom might actually go all the way around and seem fresh again.

Sumireko:
I heard there was a boom for tiny youkai, but I guess that's useless to a nyuudou.

Sumireko:
Did you know? Nowadays, you can even order memorial services on Amazon. Temples will fall behind if they don't change things up.

Sumireko:
It's been a while since I've seen a performer that spins plates. I feel like I used to see a lot of them during New Year's, though.

Sumireko:
Those headphones... Can you tell me who the manufacturer is?

Sumireko:
Pfft. These days, there are no such things as kappa. I just can't help but laugh.

Sumireko:
I've even visited the depths of the earth! Wow, Gensokyo sure goes deep.

Sumireko:
There are a surprising number of tanuki in urban places, too! Really, they're transforming and everything.

Sumireko:
Hata, Hata... Hmm, I feel like I've heard about it in history class. I wonder if it'll be on the final exam.

Sumireko:
Yay, I managed to beat Kasen-chan! Wonder where I'll have you take me this time.

Sumireko:
Yay, I managed to beat Kasen-chan!
I've never been inside the Forest of Magic. Could you show me around later?

Sumireko:
You're as strong as ever! But I won't lose, either!

Sumireko:
I've got you now! I wonder if there's some way I can take you to the outside world with me.

Sumireko:
A doppelganger? No, something's off.

Sumireko:
So there's a place called the Lunar Capital, too. I wonder what the geography is like in this world?

Sumireko:
For me, the Dream World is Gensokyo, right?

Sumireko:
So above hermits, there were celestials, too.

Sumireko:
What's that crack? Is space being cut open?

Sumireko:
A power that makes you spend more than just your assets before you realize? Was a plague god something like that?

Sumireko:
Aaah, it's a poverty god! If only I had a Get Away From Me Card!

Sumireko:
Gensokyo has turned into something really weird. But it's still fun!

Reisen:
I'll look into this incident. I still have a debt to pay as a former Moon Rabbit, after all.

Reisen:
Oh, so you were the master? Just from appearances, I could've sworn you were the slave.

Reisen:
So if that nyuudou isn't possessing you, I guess he's a REAL slave.

Reisen:
Is it okay for a monk like you to use a shady power like perfect possession?

Reisen:
I've learned a lot from my master about shikaisen and zombies as well.

Reisen:
So you are also investigating the Perfect Possession Incident.

Reisen:
About Lady Sagume...
She is an influential politician in the Lunar Capital. Reticent but bold, and also... She can be a bit scatterbrained.

Reisen:
You think you can win against lunar technology with those toys of yours? What a joke!

Reisen:
Your unconscious movements may work on everyone else, but they're completely visible to my eyes.

Reisen:
Are we reenacting the fire-crackle mountain story? Is that it?

Reisen:
The reason your face is always so stiff... Does it have to do with you being a mask youkai?

Reisen:
You may be able to control animals, but it doesn't look like you can control me!

Reisen:
The first ever Perfect Possession I saw was when Reimu switched places with you, wasnt it?

Reisen:
Master told me to be more respectful to inchlings, though... Well, whatever.

Reisen:
Rabbit Caf√©? So the rabbits in the outside world are treated extravagantly?

Reisen:
I found you... faker!

Reisen:
Hahaha! I'm the real Reisen!

Reisen:
Why is a baku like you in Gensokyo...!?

Reisen:
Long time no see. Didn't really want to see you though.

Reisen:
The fact that you showed up means that this incident has something to do with you, right?

Reisen:
No matter how extravagantly you dress up, your lowly origins still show through!

Reisen:
I'm begging you, stay away from me...

Reisen:
So that's Perfect Possession... Another effect of Urban Legend Incident, I see.

Reisen:
Hahaha! I am the Reisen from the Dream World!
It feels good to run wild in the real world once in a while!

Doremy:
Your dream self is always taking it easy. Maybe you should take some time off?

Doremy:
Thank you for the other day. The Lunarians have all returned home.

Doremy:
Your dream self is often performing superhuman acts. Could you perhaps be enamored with youkai?

Doremy:
In the Dream World, you're often treated like a highly respected Temple Guru. How straightforward.

Doremy:
To you, the Dream World and the Real World aren't much different at all. Is this the result of your training?

Doremy:
Your dream self is often in a leadership position. Just like the one you look up to.

Doremy:
You often dream of watching over and ruling the world. You really are exclusory. You wish to control Gensokyo, don't you?

Doremy:
You're always tinkering with machines, both while asleep and awake. To think I'd find such a pure soul.

Doremy:
Hm? You don't dream at all? Your heart is so hollow...

Doremy:
In your dreams, you seem to be terrified of humans. Are you scared of the ones in the outside world?

Doremy:
You're quite a bother in your dreams, always acting up. Are your emotions out of control?

Doremy:
In your dreams, you live carefree in a beautiful, tranquil world. How unexpected.

Doremy:
Have you given up on dreaming big? The Dream World you is always so quiet.

Doremy:
In you're dreams you're always gigantic. You've got a major complex about it.

Doremy:
You're a special human. Your spirit comes and goes along with your dream self.

Doremy:
Good to see you again. Thank you for visiting the dream corridor back then. I'm glad to see you're doing well.

Doremy:
I've got to monitor all the rampaging dream dwellers.

Doremy:
And here she is, the troublemaker with too much freedom. Your pure spirit is on the level of a baby.

Doremy:
You're always lurking in the Dream World, aren't you?

Doremy:
You'd really like to live a modest and simple life, don't you?

Doremy:
You only ever dream about eating to your heart's content. Huh.

Doremy:
In the Dream World, it's not uncommon for desires to manifest like that.

Doremy:
This notebook is my dream journal. The dreams of everyone who's ever dreamt are recorded here.

Tenshi:
Should I destroy the shrine again? For old time's sake?

Tenshi:
Magic is the most wicked of the wicked! Begone, heretic!

Tenshi:
Don't expect a cloud bug to be a match for a celestial, from above the clouds.

Tenshi:
They won't let you into heaven just 'cause you're enlightened, you know.

Tenshi:
So you're a hermit? Then devote yourself to it! Don‚Äôt be worried about how low you are. Consider how to get higher!

Tenshi:
Hermit, your narrowed mind ceased the flow of the wisdom! Knowledge is like water, it rots when it stagnates!

Tenshi:
Those who live under a cliff. I feel pity for you!

Tenshi:
Youkai from Underworld? Those who live one layer below the earth? You sure you aren't as same as those who were damned to hell?

Tenshi:
Oh, no! The tanukis! They're FAKE! Aww. The fact it's so classic makes it even funnier.

Tenshi:
You can take away emotions... almost like my Sword of Hisou.

Tenshi:
The path of duty lies in what is near, and men seek for it in what is remote. Hermit, haven't you made the same mistake?

Tenshi:
So how do you feel? Has immortality offered you anything good so far?

Tenshi:
An Inchling! I'm so surprised that a graceful being like you is playing on Earth.

Tenshi:
Humans who live beyond Heaven? Interesting. Interesting enough for me to knock it down.

Tenshi:
You broke up with the Lunar Capital? What a shame.

Tenshi:
Dream World? What does it have to do with the real world?

Tenshi:
Who are you? Why are you mimicking me?

Tenshi:
Hey, look at your land, it's all desecrated! How wonderful it feels!

Tenshi:
I have no jealousy in your pursued prettiness.

Tenshi:
Oh, what a poor pleb. I wish every earthling looked like you.

Tenshi:
You'd better stay away from me! I'm in a bad mood!

Tenshi:
"When two people join their hearts they can even cut metal." So, what about you two?

Tenshi:
Lie on the ground all you want! Grovel in the dirt, insect!

Yukari:
I wonder... Will you be able to resolve this incident?

Yukari:
Do you ever think that you want to become something more than human?

Yukari:
The boundary between youkai and humans... It's not very clear for you, is it.

Yukari:
Is Myouren Temple aiming to be in the same position as the Hakurei Shrine?

Yukari:
What's a good color to raise my chances of winning? Maybe I'll wear it for luck.

Yukari:
Good work. Is it going well? Gaining followers, that is.

Yukari:
Artificial Perfect Possession? I'd love it if you could explain how it works.

Yukari:
Your sister was worried about you, you know? That you were acting too freely.

Yukari:
It seemed like the tanuki of Sado were having a hard time. Wouldn't it be better if you went back to your hometown?

Yukari:
Your Noh plays might be stirring up emotions a little too much.

Yukari:
You're working hard as a hermit, aren't you.

Yukari:
By the way...
You've been keeping tabs on Sumireko voluntarily,
haven't you? That's unusual for you.

Yukari:
Would you like to have a near-death experience? By crossing the boundary between life and death.

Yukari:
I wonder when that castle floating upside-down will be forced to surrender.

Yukari:
Welcome to Gensokyo. I hope you enjoy it.

Yukari:
You've quit being a moon rabbit, haven't you? Once again, welcome to Gensokyo.

Yukari:
The ruler of dreams...? Aren't you a monster that eats dreams?

Yukari:
You were exiled from Heaven, weren't you. You must have done something really stupid.

Yukari:
The dream version of me, is it? It must be hard, living in such a cramped space.

Yukari:
As long as you don't use your cowardly tricks on me, there's no way I can lose!

Yukari:
Congratulations. You are the most hated in all of Gensokyo.

Yukari:
This Perfect Possession Incident is getting to be a bit of a problem.

Shion:
When I'm with you, I almost start to think maybe being poor isn't so bad.

Joon:
Ooh, looks like you're carrying some valuable loot. Yoink!

Joon:
I hate monks. They stink of poverty.

Shion:
Hey, look. I'm already dressed like a monk. Can I have some alms now?

Shion:
If I possessed you, you wouldn't be able to afford any more plates.

Joon:
Hey hey, can you spare something? Your dojo's so flashy, it must be profitable, right?

Joon:
You run a small-time business, huh? I feel like I'm starting to get something.

Shion:
You seem like someone who wouldn't mind being poor, huh?

Joon:
You! You counterfeiter!

Joon:
Emotions and money sense go together like bears and honey. Wanna team up?

Shion:
Never figured you'd have this much cash saved up. Not so detached, are ya?

Joon:
Ew, she reeks of poverty.

Shion:
The Miracle Mallet?! With this I'll be rich! Gold rush!

Joon:
What?! My clothes and bag are knockoff brands?! No way!

Joon:
Selling medicine must really rake in the money. Your whole business is squeezing cash from the desperate.

Joon:
We're involved with the Dream World? News to me!

Shion:
Does... Does my power work on her?

Joon:
You look rich! We're taking it all!

Joon:
Another me?! No way!

Shion:
Wait, could this be the dream me...?

Joon:
Oh, you brought me money? Thanks!

Joon:
Even if you leave it alone the bills add up. Easy as pie.

Shion:
Give me anything, please! I'm hungry!

Shion:
You've gotta give me something... Or I'll turn into the Poverty King.

Reimu:
It sure is hot...
Just glancing around here, there doesn't seem 
to be anything abnormal happening...

???:
What's up?

Larva:
If the shrine maiden's out and about, 
then did an incident happen, by any chance?
I've got more power than I know what to do with, 
so how about I help you out?

Reimu:
Good grief. Looks like the only ones benefiting from 
this season incident are you dumb fairies.
I haven't sunk so low as to need help 
from some fairy, you know.

Larva:
Oh? 
Then, how about I kick up a storm?!
My blood's totally boiling 
with midsummer heat!

Larva:
I surrenderrrr.

Reimu:
Whew. You were tougher than I thought.

Larva:
I didn't think I had that much strength 
in me either!
This blue summer sky got me pumped up.
Right now, I feel like I could even 
become the god of the new world!

Reimu:
I see...
It doesn't seem like a coincidence that the fairies 
are going nuts at the same time as the weather.

Nemuno:
What?
This here's s'posedta' be my territory.

Reimu:
Wha? 
Territory?

Nemuno:
Yeah. Outsiders like yourself 
shouldn't be bargin' on in here.

Reimu:
"Territory"... I thought this area was 
under tengu administration, but...
You sure don't look like a tengu. 
Who are you?

Nemuno:
Who am I? Ain't nobody's problem.
If you stick around here any longer, you're 
just gonna wind up as my winter food supply.

Nemuno:
Y'sure are strong! 
Who are ya, anyway?

Reimu:
Er, well, ahem. I work as the shrine maiden 
of the Hakurei Shrine.

Nemuno:
Shrine maiden? 
Feh. First I've heard of ya.
I can't help but like strong folks, though! 
Wanna come by my place?

Reimu:
Aha, I've heard of you before.
Living alone in the mountains...
There's these super-isolated youkai whose lifestyle is unknown, 
and who forgo forming societies or any connections with others.
You're a yamanba, aren't you?

Nemuno:
Yeah, I've been called that a couple a' times.
The autumn sun sets as quick as a well-bucket droppin' now.
It's gonna get freezin' cold up here on the mountain. 
You should drop by an' have some tea! C'mon, don't be shy.

Reimu:
I'm afraid I'll have to pass. 
I'm still planning to have a long life, after all...

Reimu:
Now that I take a good look at it...
The sky above my shrine is in quite the state, too.
I did think it was a little spring-y around here, 
but this... is definitely abnormal.

???:
Oh? 
Is there a fight going on down at the shrine?

Aunn:
I've been keeping watch over this place,
but the excited fairies are all that's come by.
There haven't been any dangerous 
intruders in particular.

Reimu:
Uhhhh. 
Who are you again...?

Aunn:
Aw, come on! 
I'm Komano the komainu, of course!

Reimu:
...Did we have any komainu here?

Aunn:
Why, yes! I quietly keep watch over 
shrines, temples, and the like.
As such, 
I've been watching over this shrine too.
There's been no sign of any intruders, 
so you can rest easy if you feel like heading back out.

Reimu:
Yeah, uh, hello?! YOU'RE obviously 
the one intruding here!
I'm gonna find out who you are, 
and I'm gonna be real thorough about it!

Aunn:
How mean!
All I've been doing is protecting 
the shrine for you...

Reimu:
Hm. You don't seem to be lying after all.

Aunn:
Yes! I've been protecting shrines and temples 
from simple enemies all the time until now.
It's, like, volunteer work?

Reimu:
Huh, I see. I hadn't noticed at all. 
I'm sorry.

Aunn:
No, that's all right! Contributing my help in such 
a way that I go unnoticed is fun, really.
But this time, for some reason, no matter how long I tried 
to stand around, I couldn't help but go back outside...
Maybe I was entranced by the cherry blossoms? 
Even I'm not quite sure.

Reimu:
...That aside, though, a komainu? 
You don't seem related to the season incident either.
There's only one season left to check out now, 
but I don't feel like there'll be much there either...
Is my intuition starting to fail me? 
I've never had such a total lack of leads during an incident.
Or maybe... I overlooked something big 
hidden among my previous opponents...?

Aunn:
It seems you're headed out again then!
You can leave the shrine in my capable hands!

Reimu:
A fairy, a yamanba, a komainu...
Hrrmm... Wait. Nah, no way. 
Well, no, on the other hand...

Mai:
Could you be one of the chosen ones?
I was trying to be real flashy about all this, but you still took way longer than I thought to show up.

Reimu:
Just who are you?!

???:
I'm brimming with power!

Narumi:
My, what's going on? I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I've just got to try this out on the human in front of me!

Mai:
Ahahahaha! This gal here is your next opponent.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

Reimu:
Wait-- HEY!

Narumi:
I'm not quite sure why, but it seems like this blizzard is giving me strength!

Reimu:
Hey, you! You're in the way!
I've finally got ahold of the culprit, so move it already!

Narumi:
Why, who's this? It's the Hakurei shrine maiden!
You're pretty reckless, coming into the Forest of Magic all by yourself.
There's no way I'm throwing away a chance to fight the shrine maiden, of all people!

Narumi:
Oh my, my, my. I lost!

Reimu:
Quit getting in my way. At this rate, I'll lose sight of that weirdo who was just here.
The visibility here is already awful to begin with.

Narumi:
Someone was just here...? What are you talking about?

Reimu:
The girl who was floating behind you a minute ago. Didn't you notice her?

Narumi:
Well, I'm always alone...
Aaall alone in the forest... *sniff*...

Reimu:
Oh, well. Uh. Sorry about that.
Really, though, what's going on here? Who was that just now?
...In all four seasons' locations...
There's been people who normally stay hidden, suddenly showing up with unbelivable power.
No way this is just some coincidence! There's someone pulling the strings very close by!

Narumi:
Ahh, my back feels hot for some reason~.
Even though we're in the middle of a blizzard... How strange...

Reimu:
Your back...? AH!
Uh, there's some kind of door stuck to your back?!

Narumi:
Huh? Wow, talk about scary.

Reimu:
I've got them in my sights now! Time to hop on through this thing!

Reimu:
There you are!

Mai:
What the?! How'd that human get in here...?
Ohhh. Guess I forgot to close that jizo's back-door on my way out...

Satono:
Oh, Mai. You're such a scatterbrain.
You went and pulled a human in before the order even arrived...

Mai:
Eh, well! The tide should turn in our favor now, anyway. I did a real spectacular job out there, after all.
If you ask me, Master's gonna say "well done! This is perfect."

Reimu:
Hey, hello! Who ARE you two?!

Mai:
Heh! Why, I'm Mai Teireida.

Satono:
And I'm Satono Nishida.

Mai:
Hello once again, and welcome to the Land of the Back Door (Ushirodo-no-Kuni) .

Mai:
Now, this might be a bit sudden, but let's start your test!

Reimu:
Test? What are you even talking about?

Satono:
Now, if you're too weak, our Master will get real mad at us...

Mai:
So you'd better give us all you've got! If you die, welp, that's the end of that!

Satono:
We're not gonna hold anything back, but if you go and die on us, you're totally dead meat!

Reimu:
There! I won!

Mai:
That was alright.

Satono:
Yeahhh. Passing marks, I guess?

Mai:
Alright, congrats! You paaaaassed!

Reimu:
Geeze, what's with you two? What a couple of pests. You're all beat up, and still...
You two caused the incident, right? I'm here to put a stop to it!

Mai:
You mean the 'four seasons' incident?
Nah, that wasn't us.

Reimu:
Wait, for real?

Satono:
For really real! It's not our fault.

Reimu:
C-Come on! That's totally ridiculous!
Ugh, I was so sure I'd caught the culprit...

Satono:
See, we can draw out a target's latent abilities to an infinite extent by dancing behind their backs.

Mai:
We received orders to seek out potential in people who are normally hidden...
And to capture any aggressive talented folks such as yourself.

Satono:
The season incident was caused by the fairies, sprites and divine spirits who went berserk because of our dancing.

Reimu:
...hmm, uh...?
Well, so, then the season incident was indirectly your fault anyway, wasn't it.

Satono:
Are you sure about that~?

Mai:
Well, you passed the test, sooo...
We hereby invite you to meet the ultimate god hidden behind your back!

Reimu:
*pant, pant*...
I hardly expected there to be such a big place behind a door in someone's back...
The world really is full of wonders.

???:
Ah, I see you've arrived.

Okina:
You're the human who my two servants mentioned, I see.

Reimu:
There you are! You're the ringleader of the incident!

Okina:
Incident?
If you mean the out-of-order seasons, the berserk fairies are to blame for that.
A natural phenomenon, essentially. It's nobody's responsibility.

Reimu:
I'm not here to listen to any of your excuses! Here I go!

Okina:
Well, wait a moment.
We'll be parting ways after this anyway, so why not talk for a while longer?
My name is Okina Matara.

Okina:
I am the god of the back door, a god of hindrances,
a god of noh performance, a god of outcasts, a god of stars...
And I am one of the sages who created our Gensokyo.
Sooner or later, I need to find some successors to take over from those two servants of mine.

Reimu:
Successors? What are you planning to do with me?

Okina:
However... that lousy pair certainly brought me a strong human, that's for sure.
The Hakurei shrine maiden, of all people!
Well, it should go without saying that you don't meet the qualifications. You can feel free to return to the front-facing world.

Reimu:
What? Quit playing around already!
You might not have any business with me, but I sure have some with you!
Resolving this incident is my job! I'm gonna defeat you and return Gensokyo to normal!

Okina:
How very foolish.
Let me declare this! Victory against me is impossible in your current state.
As long as you have that door of the seasons on your back, any battle between us will be nothing more than a farce.

Reimu:
Hmph! Stop quibbling already, let's just go!

Okina:
Fine, very well. If you so insist, then show me!
Show me the noh of darkness that you dance in this maddening frenzy of danmaku!

Cirno:
Wahooo!
Summer is the BEST!

???:
Wahooo! 
It sure is!

Larva:
Oh my, you've got a tan! 
Are you enjoying this fine summer day?

Cirno:
Heck yeah I am! 
Summer is when I, the great ice fairy, can show my true power!

Larva:
We butterfly fairies are hardly going to lose either! 
I'm surging with endless strength!

Cirno & Larva:
LET'S FIGHT TO SEE WHO SUMMER BELONGS TO!

Cirno:
I win! 
Summer is officially mine!

Larva:
I lost~. 
You sure are something!

Cirno:
Man, I've NEVER been this 
powerful before!
I'm gonna charge onward and conquer Gensokyo!

Larva:
Fight on for my share, too! 
We're all counting on you!

Cirno:
Leave it to me! 
I shall create the future of us fairies with my own two hands!

Nemuno:
What?
This here's s'posedta' be my territory.

Cirno:
Like I care! 
I'm the fairy who shall soon lord over Gensokyo!
I can go anywhere and do 
anything I want!

Nemuno:
An overlord, eh? Well, sure, have 
fun with your lordin' or whatever.
More importantly, you oughta 
git on outta here.

Cirno:
BAH! 
You're looking at me like I'm an idiot, aren't you?
In that case, I'll be taking forcible action!

Nemuno:
Assertive little fairy, aren'tcha.
All right. 
I'll cut ya open, just like ya asked!

Nemuno:
Are you seriously a fairy? 
You've sure got some guts!

Cirno:
I dunno! I'm just feeling really strong.
I bet it's because of 
the midsummer sun.

Nemuno:
Midsummer?
What're ya talkin' about? 
It's midfall right now.

Cirno:
"Midfall?"
Oh, you're right! 
It's gotten cold all of a sudden!
W-What's going on? 
It was definitely midsummer until noon...

Nemuno:
Are y'sure you're really 
"Gensokyo overlord" material...?
Welp, you just head along now, 
lil' miss overlord.

Cirno:
Eh, whatever. 
Now that it's cool out, I can REALLY show my true power!

Cirno:
Woah, the shrine's full of fall leaves!

???:
Fall leaves?

Aunn:
Wow. You can't even tell the difference 
between cherry petals and leaves.

Cirno:
Cherry petals? 
Don't be stupid! It's fall, those would never...
Whaaa?! 
They ARE cherry petals!

Aunn:
What an idiot. 
You sure have an impressive aura, though...

Cirno:
What the heck is all this? 
This's awesome! It's only been one day...!
In just one day, it's turned from 
midsummer to midfall to mid'sprin!

Aunn:
Um. "Midfall" and 
"mid'sprin" aren't words.

Cirno:
Huh? Really?
Whatever, though! Once I rule the land, 
I'll make them into official words!

Aunn:
You seem to be stronger than usual. I mean, so 
are all the other fairies around here, but still.

Aunn:
Sorry, miss fairy, but I'm gonna 
have to chase you outta here.
As this shrine's guardian beast!

Aunn:
S-So strong...!
I knew that the fairies were stronger, but 
I hardly imagined they were this strong...

Cirno:
Yes! I'm one step closer to 
becoming supreme overlord!

Aunn:
I mean, I bet I could've won if 
I'd really gotten serious...
It's just that if I use any more of my 
power, I fear I might lose control of it.

Cirno:
What, you a sore loser or somethin'? 
Sooo laaaame!

Aunn:
Grhrhgh.

Cirno:
A'ight, where am I 
gonna head next?
I feel like I can't lose to ANYONE right now!

Aunn:
Well, if you're leaving the shrine, 
I'll hardly be one to complain.
You should be careful, though. "Temporary" power 
always has something else lurking behind it.
I've sensed an evil intent behind that power, and... 
oh, she's already gone!
My goodness. She's in for a rough time.

Mai:
Hm? Hey, you fairy over there. 
What's up?

Cirno:
So you're my next opponent, eh?!
Let's battle for the title of the strongest!

Mai:
Pfffft!
Who do you even think is responsible for squirts 
like you having that power in the first place?

???:
I'm brimming with power!

Narumi:
My, what's going on? 
I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I feel like taking this out for a spin on some fairies!

Mai:
Ahahahaha! 
You two have fun beating on each other, now.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

Cirno:
Hmph. I dunno what the heck 
that lady was on about...
But hey! A stronger enemy showed up, 
so I'll just roll with that.

Narumi:
This out-of-season blizzard might make it hard to tell, but...
This is the Forest of Magic, you know?

Cirno:
And?

Narumi:
It doesn't matter who it is. There's nobody 
who can stand up to a magic specialist like me!

Cirno:
You moron! 
You big ol' hat-headed moron!
Victory is decided by whoever's the strongest!
So victory is mine!

Narumi:
Well, aren't you confident.
As a symbol of Jizo, I exist in this world to provide 
salvation to all creatures in this era without Buddhas...
But fairies sure don't count. 
'Tis a bitter shame! I'll see you in your next life!

Narumi:
W-What's with this fairy?! 
She actually packs a punch!

Cirno:
Total pushover. 
I can feel power surging forth again and again~!

Narumi:
I see... I did get the feeling that there was 
more power dwelling in me than usual,
but it looks like you had that same 
power within you too!
If we were both using performance enhancers for that fight, 
then it figures that a fairy would be so powerful.

Cirno:
Nah, that's totally not it! 
This is my own true strength, fair and square!

Narumi:
Well, to tell you the truth, 
my magic allows me to control life.
Fairies are pure life energy, so if I really got serious, 
I should've been able to completely nullify you...
But for some reason, it didn't work on you.

Cirno:
What are you trying to say?

Narumi:
In short, you're running on some power 
other than that of mere fairies right now...
Wha?! 
Uh, there's a door stuck to your back?!

Cirno:
There's a what-now on my back? 
...Waagh?!

Narumi:
The fairy vanished...!? It's like she got sucked
away somewhere when she touched her own back...
....
...Well, fairies aren't salvation targets anyway. 
Nothin' to see here, nothin' to see here.

Cirno:
Where is this? 
It's all dark and boring in here...

Mai:
What the?! 
Is this that fairy from earlier?
Wow. Guess that means she won against the jizo 
girl back there, huh? What a surprise.

Cirno:
Who're you? 
Why do you know who I am?

Mai:
Huh? 
...Was I just imagining that we met earlier?

???:
Oh, Mai. 
You're such a scatterbrain...
Like literally, what are we going to do 
with a fairy. Come on.

Mai:
I mean, I was expecting the magic jizo 
what's-her-name to get chosen.
Looks like we've got an unforeseen outcome on our hands!

Cirno:
What are you two babbling about?
I'm always ready to rumble, you know!

Mai:
Unexpected stuff is the best spice of life.

Satono:
Oh, Mai, Mai, Mai. That attitude is what 
always lands you up the creek, you know?

Mai:
Aw, c'mon. An unforeseen fairy got chosen! 
Isn't that okay too?

Satono:
If she's got the power to back it up, of course...
Which means it's time for a test! 
Show us what you're really made of!

Cirno:
Okay, who's gonna fight me first? 
Decide quick!

Mai:
Unexpected stuff is the best spice of life. 
Don't you think so too?
Be overjoyed, O little warrior tribesman! 
Your opponent shall be both of us at once!

Cirno:
Y-You still wanna go?!

Mai:
Yeah, that oughta be fine.

Satono:
My, that was actually all right. 
By fairy standards... However...

Mai:
Sorry, but you don't pass.

Cirno:
Whaaat?! 
Are you makin' fun of me?

Mai:
In the end, you were only fighting 
with the power that we gave you.

Satono:
Your original power is hardly 
anything worth noting.

Cirno:
What are you two babbling about now?
I won, didn't I? Plain as day!

Mai:
That was a test, is the thing.

Satono:
You're only being strengthened by 
our powers, right now.
We were just pretending to put up a fight 
so that we could gauge your original strength.

Cirno:
Quit MESSING with me! 
Are you two sayin' you did somethin' to my power?!
Aha! Now I see! 
The truth is that I'm even more powerful than this!

Satono:
Sorry, hang on a second.
...Huh? 
...Understood.

Mai:
What was that? 
Did Master give us a call?

Satono:
Yes, she's summoned us.
We're probably in for a scolding.

Mai:
Blech! 
This is the worst.

Cirno:
She said to hang on for one second, 
but they just up and left.
...Err. Uhhh? 
What am I supposed to do now?
Plus, those two kind of seemed like 
they weren't even paying attention to me...
.....
Perfect! 
This means I've got a free pass to smash this place up!

Cirno:
Where did those two weirdos 
run off to, anyway?
Aside from that, though, 
this place is so dark and boring.
I'm gonna leave.

Okina:
What are you doing here?
What on Earth are those two layabouts doing? 
There's some weird fairy wandering around in here.

Cirno:
Who the heck are you?! 
You seem real strong!
Come, do battle with me! 
We'll fight for the title of the strongest!

Okina:
Have you not noticed yet?
Even if you're a fairy, if you run rampant any more 
than this, you won't be able to hold yourself together.
Look, your skin is browning as we speak. 
Isn't that proof enough?

Cirno:
Whaat?! This is just a tan! 
It's a summer medal of honor!

Okina:
You're mistaken.
The effects of your supercharged rampage 
are merely spreading to your appearance.
You should get out of here before your 
sense of self completely breaks down.
I'll tell those two to deactivate the 
power at your back that they granted.
Your strength will safely weaken, 
and your skin should soon return to normal.

Cirno:
What d'you mean, "power at my back?"

Okina:
That season weaponry that's been 
following you around. See?
Without its influence, your power would be 
a mere shadow of what it is right now.

Cirno:
What?! 
This is my power!
You're just scared of the strongest fighter around, aren'tcha? 
C'mon, let's just have a little fight!

Okina:
I'm the one keeping your power in check right now. 
A fight between the two of us would be the very height of foolishness.
But... all right. 
I'm interested in the power of fairies, too.
It might not be so bad to choose a fairy 
for my subordinate once in a while.
Of course, that's only if you 
prove your power to be worthy.
Unleash your power to its fullest strength!
And then show me! 
Show me the noh of darkness that a fairy dances!

Aya:
So above the forests in the foothills, it's midsummer.
Even though it was autumn over at the mountain...

???:
I've got way too much power!

Larva:
Hey, you! Yes, you in the black over there. 
Are you enjoying this summer day?
If you've got nothing else to do, come cool 
me off with that stupid-big fan of yours!

Aya:
The seasons are strange, but the fairies' 
excitement certainly is too.

Aya:
You don't seem related to the incident, so without 
further ado, allow me to blow you into next week.

Larva:
Woohoo! Let's fight, let's fight! 
It's time for a midsummer war!

Larva:
I surrenderrrr.

Aya:
Mm. I've gone and wasted my energy on something 
that had nothing to do with the incident.
That said, though... 
You're quite strong for a fairy.

Larva:
I've got way more power than I know what to do with. 
I feel like I could even become the god of the new world right now!

Aya:
An insect fairy going berserk... 
Well, I suppose the summer heat just got to her.
This doesn't seem big enough to write an article about. 
Let's continue gathering material on the abnormal weather.

???:
What? 
What's a tengu like you doin' here?
You're not s'posed t' be here. We made an agreement.

Aya:
Whoops, please excuse me.
This was your territory, yes?

Nemuno:
If you're sayin' you came in here already 
knowing that, we're gonna have a problem.

Aya:
I came here to do a bit of journalism.
This spot appears to be the exact center of the autumn area, 
so I would greatly appreciate it if I could ask you a few questions?

Nemuno:
This mountain doesn't just belong to 
you tengu, you know.
So that's your way of doin' things, huh? Decidin' 
all by yourselves to scrap our non-aggression treaty?

Nemuno:
In that case, I'll give ya a warm welcome 
with my way of doin' things.
A yamanba's way, that is!

Aya:
Let's pause for a moment.
I bear no ill will of 
any kind towards you.
We respect the independent and naturalistic 
way of life that yamanba follow.
I simply came here because I wish 
to ask you a few questions...

Nemuno:
Ah hah hah! 
You tengu sure are a crafty lot, after all!
You come in an' threaten someone with force, an' then 
have the gall to say "I just want to ask some questions?"
I like you! 
I'll accept any interview or whatever you've got.

Aya:
Thank you ever so much.
I knew all along that your species 
is actually quite friendly.

Nemuno:
So, what's this interview about?

Aya:
Have you noticed anything in particular 
about this year's autumn?

Nemuno:
Ehh... is there somethin' goin' on?

Aya:
What beautiful cherry blossoms...
It seems that the shrine's been taken over 
by berserk fairies and youkai, though.
Is Reimu out, I wonder? 
She sure is laid-back.

???:
A tengu reporter?

???:
If you're here for one of your violent interviews, 
I'll have to decline. Just leave right now, okay?

Aya:
Huh? 
Just who are you...?

Aunn:
I'm Komano the komainu, 
this shrine's guardian god!
I chase away intruders while 
the shrine maiden is out.

Aya:
A komainu, hm? 
Was there really one of these around?
Well, that's fine. 
I'd like to ask you a few questions?

Aunn:
Hello? I just said I'm 
chasing away intruders.
If you intend to stay in this shrine 
any longer, I'll give you no mercy!

Aya:
So, I'd like to ask you about 
these abnormal cherry blossoms.

Aunn:
I don't agree with violeeence...

Aya:
Excuse me? You were trying to 
violently chase me out just now.

Aunn:
Aw, fine.
So, the cherry blossoms, was it? Or was it 
the berserk fairies you wanted to know about?

Aya:
I'd like to know about anything out of the 
ordinary that you've noticed, yes.

Aunn:
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything 
about what's going on.
Really, I've got nothing.

Aya:
Is that so...? 
Your expression does seem to say as much.
That yamanba from before didn't 
have any information, either.
We've got an incident big enough to cover all of Gensokyo, 
but absolutely no clues as to the ringleader...
This may be the work of someone far more insidious 
and strategically-minded than I thought!
I can feel a once-in-a-thousand-years scoop coming on!

Mai:
Woah, a tengu...?

Aya:
Yes, that's right.
I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
Could you perhaps spare a moment?

Mai:
Nuh-uh-uh. Nah. Nope. 
We might have the same classification, but you're our mortal enemy!
I did imagine that a tengu might show 
up, but geeze, what a surprise...!

???:
I'm brimming with power!

Narumi:
My, what's going on? 
I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I don't care who! 
I want to try this power out on someone!

Mai:
Ahaha, just in time. 
This gal here is your opponent.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

Aya:
Ah... 
She ran off.
I'm interested in this new face too, though. 
Could you lend me a moment of your time?

Narumi:
Sure! 
Thanks for facing off with me!

Aya:
Facing off? 
You do mean for an interview, right?

Narumi:
Nope, not at all. 
It seems like this blizzard is giving me strength...
So I'm gonna hurl all that strength at you! 
Eat this, you damn dirty tengu!

Aya:
What a pointlessly belligerent attitude...
Not bad, if you ask me! 
In fact, it's my favorite!

Aya:
All right, then. Let's proceed with the interview.

Narumi:
...*sob sob* 
'Kay.

Aya:
You said a moment ago that the blizzard was giving 
you power. What exactly did you mean by that?

Narumi:
Sorry, but I'm not sure either. 
I can feel a strange power flowing forth, or something...?
I'm not usually this eager to fight, either. 
I want to live a nice, quiet life, if anything!
Also... my back feels kind of hot, I think.

Aya:
...Who was that girl carrying the bamboo 
a moment ago? Do you know her?

Narumi:
Wha? A girl with bamboo? 
Who are you talking about?

Aya:
The strange girl who was dancing 
behind you before we fought.

Narumi:
You're kidding! Sure, this is a pretty harsh blizzard, 
but I could definitely tell if someone was dancing right behind me.

Aya:
..."Jizo statues have zero ability to 
pay attention." Noted.

Narumi:
My back's felt hot for a while now, so I've turned around to see 
what's the matter many times, but there hasn't been anyone there.

Aya:
If your back feels hot... you should go see a doctor. 
Or maybe a mason would be better, in your case.
Hm? 
Um, miss? There's a door stuck to your back?!

Narumi:
Huh? 
Wow, talk about scary.

Aya:
I see! That girl from before was possessing you 
via your back and giving you power!
Perhaps she was hiding in the backs of 
all the others I fought, too...
If you don't enter a tiger's lair, you can't catch its cubs! 
Let's see... wow, there's a lot of room in here.

Aya:
I've finally found a material witness! 
With that, I'd like to begin our interview.

Mai:
What?! 
The tengu from before?! How'd you get in here...?!

Aya:
I went through the Jizo's back.

Mai:
Ack. Guess I left the door open...?

Satono:
Oh, Mai. 
You're such a scatterbrain.
What were you even thinking, bringing a tengu in here? 
We're never going to hear the end of this.

Mai:
Ehh, yeah, I did mess up... 
But I don't think Master will get mad at us.
Our job is to drive tengu away, after all. 
All we gotta do is shoot her down here.

Aya:
Your job is to drive tengu away...? 
What in the world are you two?

Mai:
I'm Mai Teireida.

Satono:
And I'm Satono Nishida. 
We're twin douji who serve a god of hindrances.
We're fundamentally the same type of being as you.

Aya:
A god of hindrances... 
I feel like I've heard that phrase before somewhere.

Satono:
Yes, a god of hindrances... 
A god who works to prevent things.

Mai:
Our job is to behave the same way as tengu, 
in order to drive tengu away!

Aya:
I only wanted to interview the two of you 
about the four seasons incident, but...
It looks like I've got no choice but to fight.

Mai:
I didn't expect to have to do this 
right here, of all places, but...
Behold! Feast your eyes on us two servants' 
secret ceremony, the "Tengu-Odoshi"! (Tengu Frightening)

Aya:
Hmph! You're all bark and no bite.

Mai:
Wow, she's strong. 
Sure didn't expect that.

Satono:
It seems that we underestimated her.

Aya:
There's no need for me to show 
such hostility towards you.
All I want is information on the four 
seasons incident. That's all.

Mai:
The season incident? 
Nah, that's not our fault.

Aya:
Huh? 
Really?

Satono:
See, we can draw out a target's latent abilities to 
an infinite extent by dancing behind their backs.

Mai:
We received orders to seek out potential 
in people who are normally hidden...
And to drive away any youkai who serve as 
hindrances, such as tengu and the like.

Satono:
The season incident was caused by the fairies, sprites 
and divine spirits who went berserk because of our dancing.

Aya:
Jotting all this down... 
So, to sum it all up: 
Your superior ordered the two of you to grant 
power to youkai in various places.
The fairies went berserk as a side effect of that, 
which made nature become strange...
So you two are the culprit behind 
the season incident, aren't you?

Satono:
Sorry, hang on a second.
...Huh? 
...Understood.

Mai:
What was that? 
Did Master give us a call?

Satono:
Yes, she's summoned us.
We're probably in for a scolding.

Mai:
Blech! 
This is the worst.

Aya:
...They don't seem to be coming back.
Well, I've managed to find the culprit 
responsible for the season incident, but...
A god of hindrances, hm... I really do feel like 
I've heard about one in tengu history before...

Aya:
I would have liked to ask those two 
some more questions, but that aside...
This is quite the mysterious world we have here.
To think that a jizo's back would have 
such a vast world inside of it...

Okina:
Ah hah hah! 
How very interesting!
A tengu, in the Land of the Back Door! 
Just what is this world coming to?
I'm a being meant to govern hindrances, 
just like tengu, but we belong in different places.

Aya:
Just like tengu...? 
What in the world are you?

Okina:
My name is Okina Matara.
I am the god of the back door, 
a god of hindrances,
a god of noh performance, 
a god of outcasts, a god of stars...

Aya:
That's a lot of titles.

Okina:
Heh heh heh. 
Well, a tengu such as yourself should already understand.
Understand the fact, of course, that no god could 
possibly have so many divine natures at once...

Aya:
...Meaning?

Okina:
You think I'm lying, don't you?

Aya:
Well, yes.
Or perhaps you're not lying, but I get the feeling 
that you're concealing your true nature.

Okina:
Well, I'm an absolute secret god. 
This may very well be my true nature after all.

Aya:
Hindrances... a secret god... 
Oh, I remember now!
Our ancestors, the people of hindrances, split into two groups. 
One settled in the mountains and became tengu.
The other hid behind buddhas, living in human settlements. 
That is to say, a secret god of hindrances...
Could you be...?!

Okina:
How many times must I say it? 
I am that very god.
I have a wide variety of titles, but which one 
do you think most accurately represents my true form?

Aya:
Didn't you say just a moment ago 
that your true form was that of a "secret god?"

Okina:
"A god of hindrances" also means 
"a god of tengu-warding."
That is to say, I am a god who 
eliminates tengu from this world.
That's why I laughed at first. 
A tengu, of all things, has entered the land of tengu-warding.
Such utter cheek that you crow of! 
Be vanquished in earnest, you foolish tengu reporter!

Marisa:
What's the big idea here?!
It's freakin' HOT!

???:
What've we got here?

Larva:
Of course summer is hot. 
Even fairies know that.

Marisa:
I thought it wasn't gonna be this hot! 
That's why I'm all bundled up like this.
Ugh, it's so hot I could just die!

Larva:
Now that I look at you, you're totally dressed 
for the wrong season. You look so dumb!

Larva:
Come on! Get some exercise, and taste 
this summer heat with your whole body!

Larva:
So hoooot!

Marisa:
Hot indeed!

Larva:
If it's so hot then why 
are you dressed like that?

Marisa:
It's so cold over where I live that it's snowing! 
It's practically winter!
Seriously, what is going on?

Larva:
That sure is a good joke. 
It's the height of summer right now.

Marisa:
Yeah, I can see that. 
It's definitely summer 'round here.
Haven't had an incident this hard to get a hold of in a while. 
I'm not even sure where to go investigate next.

Nemuno:
What?
This here's s'posedta' be my territory.

Marisa:
Huh, haven't seen you before.
Who are you?

Nemuno:
That oughta be my line.
I've always been livin' here. 
Never moved an inch!
And all of a sudden, you came flyin' up.

Marisa:
Oh, sorry about that. 
I'm Marisa the magician.
I'm not sure why, but it seems like the season around 
this one area has turned into autumn?

Nemuno:
I don't know nothin' 'bout that. 
More importantly, you should git outta here.
If you stick around here any longer, 
I'll slice you open an' sun-dry you!

Nemuno:
Whew, you're strong. 
Y'said you were a magician?

Marisa:
Yes. Although a human one, 
admittedly.

Nemuno:
Oho. A human, eh?
As humans go, you remind me a' that 
legendary Kintoki kid.
I like you! 
I'll hear any questions y'got.

Marisa:
Really? Okay, then.
Do you know anything about the one who made it into 
autumn just around this one area?

Nemuno:
"Just this one area?" 
The heck y'mean by that?

Marisa:
Are you aware that there's abnormal weather 
occurring in various places in Gensokyo?

Nemuno:
Nah.

Marisa:
Could you please tell me any other places 
where there's been strange weather.

Nemuno:
I ain't never left here, 
so I dunno nothin'.

Marisa:
...Sorry to have bothered you.

Marisa:
The shrine's pretty weird, too. This is the 
only place with so many cherry trees blooming.
Although, I can't imagine the culprit of an incident 
would be hanging around at the shrine...

???:
Oh, miss Marisa! Hello!

Aunn:
Miss Reimu is out at the moment.

Marisa:
Who the heck are you?

Aunn:
Oh, don't be like that! 
I'm Komano the komainu!
Although this is our first time talking.

Marisa:
Is it, now.

Aunn:
I may not look it, but I've been quietly protecting 
shrines and temples for quite some time now!

Marisa:
Komainu are... those things, right? 
Those statues people always use as meet-up locations.

Aunn:
Well, yes, I suppose. Despite appearances, 
I'm the guardian god of this shrine.

Marisa:
Ah hah hah! 
Pretendin' to be an ally won't trick me!

Marisa:
Some guardian god you are! 
The shrine's smack-dab in the middle of an incident right now!
I'm gonna beat you down and turn 
the shrine's season back to normal!

Aunn:
I lost~!
I came here to do everything I could 
for the shrine, but I got beaten up...

Marisa:
I didn't feel any aura comin' from you 
that was related to the incident after all.
Well, uh, y'know. 
Sorry.

Aunn:
I told you I was on the shrine's side 
in the first place, didn't I?

Marisa:
So, will you help me out with 
my incident investigation?

Aunn:
Yes, certainly!
I've only been around the shrines and temples, 
but the only things that were out of the ordinary...
Were the fairies going berserk? 
Besides that, not much.

Marisa:
Those little squirts always freak 
out during incidents, though.
Aside from that...
There's the fact that a komainu like you, who usually 
does stuff in hiding, is out and about...
Now that I think about it, that does seem weird.
I guess I'll check out the last season's location 
just to be safe, then draw my conclusion?

Aunn:
Good luck! 
I'll be cheering you on from the shadows!

Marisa:
Let's table the cheering. It'll just throw me off.

Mai:
Could you be one of the 
chosen ones?
I was trying to be real flashy about all this, 
but you still took way longer than I thought to show up.

Marisa:
Are you the one who did this to the forest?!

???:
I'm brimming with power!

Narumi:
My, what's going on? 
I'm practically overflowing with magic power...
I've just got to try this out 
on the human in front of me!

Mai:
Ahahahaha! 
This gal here is your next opponent.
Welp, time for me to head on back!

Marisa:
Hey! Get back here!

Narumi:
I'm not quite sure why, 
but it seems like this blizzard is giving me strength!

Marisa:
Hey... Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Oh, I remember now. You're Naruko the magic jizo, aren'tcha?

Narumi:
I recognize that voice... Marisa, the magic human?
This magic blizzard is so bad that I could barely tell it was you.

Marisa:
I'm chasing that girl who was just here, 
so could you get outta my way?

Narumi:
I don't want to. 
I'm in the mood to test out my magic today!

Marisa:
Never thought I'd hear that from a shut-in introvert like you... 
You really think you can beat me?

Narumi:
With today's blizzard at my back, 
I feel like I can take on anything!
That's my only reason, really! 
Let's go!

Narumi:
I've still got plenty of power!

Marisa:
Hold on, time out.
Isn't there something a bit off about your magic today?
How do I put this... like, the magic energy 
is flowin' out in a really abnormal way.
It's comin' out from behind you. 
You have to have noticed by now, right?

Narumi:
Oh, you're right... 
It feels kind of like my back is on fire.

Marisa:
Gotcha. That bothers me too, but... 
who was that person here earlier anyway?

Narumi:
What person? 
What are you talking about?

Marisa:
The girl who was dancing behind you. 
What, you didn't notice her?

Narumi:
I thought I've always been alone, though?

Marisa:
Oh, right. You're the type who 
likes your solitude an' all.

Narumi:
Ah, but still, 
my back is just so hot...

Marisa:
You ARE in a blizzard. Maybe it's frostbite? 
Let me a have look.
Huh? 
What the heck?!
You've got a door on your back!

Narumi:
Huh? 
Wow, talk about scary.

Marisa:
No doubt about it. All that energy 
is coming from this door...

Narumi:
What on Earth is happening to me? 
Do something, Marisa!

Marisa:
Ugh... this is really obviously a trap, but...
Well, it's not like I can just ignore my only clue. 
"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you!"

Marisa:
What's with this place...?
I can't believe there's such a big world 
inside of Naruko's back.

Mai:
What the?! 
How'd that human get in here...?
Ohhh. Guess I forgot to close that 
jizo's back-door on my way out...

Satono:
Oh, Mai. 
You're such a scatterbrain.
You went and pulled a human in 
before the order even arrived...

Mai:
Eh, well! The tide should turn in our favor now, anyway. 
I did a real spectacular job out there, after all.
If you ask me, Master's gonna say 
"well done! This is perfect."

Marisa:
Who are you people? 
And where is this place?

Mai:
Heh! Why, I'm Mai Teireida.

Satono:
And I'm Satono Nishida.
Hello once again,
and welcome to the Land of the Back Door (Ushirodo-no-Kuni) .

Marisa:
Land of the Back Door? 
Never heard of it.
I figured that this was a trap, 
but I can't back down now!

Mai:
Don't worry, 
this isn't a trap.
But we will be giving you a test now, 
to see if you're one of the chosen ones.

Satono:
Now, if you're too weak, our 
Master will get real mad at us...

Mai:
So you'd better give us all you've got! 
If you die, welp, that's the end of that!

Satono:
We're not gonna hold anything back, 
but if you go and die on us, you're totally dead meat!

Marisa:
You're not half-bad!

Mai:
Okaay! That's good enough.

Satono:
You did all right. Passing marks, I guess?

Mai:
Alright, congrats! 
You paaaaassed!

Marisa:
P-pass? Pass what? 
What's this all about?

Satono:
See, we can draw out a target's latent abilities to 
an unlimited extent by dancing behind their backs.

Mai:
We received orders to seek out potential 
in people who are normally hidden...
And we're looking for especially 
aggressive talent like you.

Marisa:
Drawing out latent abilities... Ah-hah. 
So that's what the door on Naruko's back was doing?
Wait, so are the four seasons going crazy 
because you're drawing out the latent potential of the fairies?

Mai:
Well, it's more like a side effect. 
The fairies are just going crazy on their own.

Marisa:
You want someone talented so badly that you're willing 
to let the fairies throw Gensokyo into chaos...
An' that someone is me, eh? 
I see, I see.

Mai:
Well, you passed the test, sooo...
We hereby invite you 
to meet the ultimate god hidden behind your back!

Marisa:
So where exactly is she? 
This hidden god of theirs?
And what is this world anyway?
It's just doors as far as the eye can see...

Okina:
Ah, I see you've arrived.
You're the human who my two servants mentioned, I see.

Marisa:
Yup, probably.

Okina:
Hmm.
Why are you dressed like that? 
Rather strange fashion sense you have.

Marisa:
This here's a magician's uniform! 
It's strange, sure, but for a magician it's a pretty good look.
And how about you, anyway? 
Who exactly are you?

Okina:
My name is Okina Matara.
I am the god of the back door, 
a god of hindrances,
a god of noh performance, 
a god of outcasts, a god of stars...
And I am one of the sages 
who created our Gensokyo.
Sooner or later, I need to find some successors 
to take over from those two servants of mine.

Marisa:
Successors? 
By 'two servants,' you mean those dancers from before, right?

Okina:
Yes. They're my precious arms and legs, which is why 
I periodically swap them out for new humans.

Marisa:
So, what does the job normally entail?

Okina:
I suppose you could say you'd be a fixer, 
keeping the balance in Gensokyo from behind the scenes.
Well, it's an easy job.

Marisa:
I dunno if that's really that easy, 
although it does sound interesting.
But I refuse!
I live my life doing 
whatever I want.
If I had to live like those two just now? 
Thanks, but no thanks.

Okina:
Ah ha ha! 
Aren't you misunderstanding something?
I never gave you a choice 
from the outset.

Marisa:
What?

Okina:
I am the one who chooses my servants. 
Certainly no one ever asked you.

Marisa:
Hmph, so you're coming after me with brute force? 
That suits me just fine!

Okina:
As long as you have that door of the seasons on your back, 
any battle between us will be nothing more than a farce.
Now, let us begin the final test of darkness. 
If you disappoint me, I'll kill you!

Mai:
Oh, it's you again?

Satono:
We heard that you didn't make the cut. Can't say I saw that one coming!

Mai:
Which means you're not qualified to be here!

Reimu:
Come on out already!

???:
Why, to think that you'd come back here...

Okina:
How very brave of you. You have my respect.
However, you should understand by now that victory against me is impossible.

Reimu:
Well, yeah, 'cause you got up and ran off in the middle of our battle.

Okina:
What? It seems that you're misremembering things.
You're the one who ran.
I helped myself to the magic power that I had led you to collect...
Which rendered you helpless in the end, so you fled. Didn't you?

Reimu:
I fled? That's ridiculous. There's no way.

Okina:
You really don't remember... Well, I happen to remember it just fine.
With all your weapons sealed off, you escaped through your own door and returned home.
Through the very same season door you have right now. Do you want to meet the same fate again?

Reimu:
The season door... So that was it, after all.
I don't remember fleeing, but there was a moment when I thought "wait, hang on a second...?"
Because before I even knew it, I'd been returned to the location of the season I'd collected.
In other words, the door on my back was a trap that both absorbs magic power and forcibly ejects people!

Okina:
Indeed. You did well to figure it out.
That's why you have no chance of victory. No matter what, you'll be chased out of here in the end.

Reimu:
Heh heh heh.

Okina:
Hm? What's the matter? Do you have a screw loose?

Reimu:
My theory was correct! Victory is mine!

Okina:
What's this, now?

Reimu:
Take a look at my back.
This time, I've been gathering the boundary between seasons!
That means there's no location in existence for me to get ejected to!

Okina:
Oho... I see that the door on your back right now...
Corresponds to doyou, the border between seasons where the world loses its vitality entirely.

Okina:
Hm hm hm. Not a bad strategy.
However, this also means that you've cut off your own escape route.

Reimu:
That just means I won't budge an inch until I beat you for good, this time!

Okina:
Hah hah! I like you!
You're the Hakurei shrine maiden, so I can't make you my subordinate,
but as a show of respect for your intelligence...
I'll fight you without using the seasonal magic that I've gathered.
See it! Hear it! Speak of it! The secret god's true magic power shall be your greatest hindrance!

Reimu:
Did I beat her?!

Okina:
I've been beatennn!
Only natural for the Hakurei maiden, of course. To think that you'd evade all of my attacks...!

Reimu:
Okay, now I've won for real.
So give up on all your evil schemes right now!

Okina:
Mmm~mm, what am I gonna do now~?
I still haven't found successors for my servants or anythi~ing...
And without their successors, I can't release those two girls any time soon. Poor thi~ings...

Reimu:
Try hiring people in a way that doesn't make a huge mess of the seasons.
Like flyers. Or interviews, or something...

Okina:
Me, a secret god? Do that? I don't wann~a.
But eh, it's fine. Guess I'll just have those two keep working at it for a while.

Reimu:
Why do youkai insist on making such a big show of everything, anyway?
You always get way too chummy with me as soon as you lose, too.

Okina:
I'm not a youkai, I'm a god!
By the way...
About that whole "use the border between seasons as your backdoor" technique...
You didn't come up with that by yourself, did you?
A method that uses borders like that... it reminds me a lot of a certain someone I'm rather familar with.

Reimu:
...Well, who knows.
Honestly, I don't really understand the logic behind it either?
Like, what's with all of this? Doors on people's backs, seasonal weaponry, berserk life force, blah blah blah...
Trying to understand all this ridiculous youkai theory is just impossible, if you ask me!

Okina:
Not youkai, though! A god!
Really, it's only natural that all of this would exceed human understanding.

Reimu:
Yes, okay. Sure.

Okina:
From where I'm standing, though, I'd say you seem more like one of "our side" too.

Reimu:
Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna head back soon.
...Uh, which door should I go through to get back home?

Okina:
If you want the Hakurei Shrine, I'd recommend the door 2nd from the bottom and 40th from the right.

Reimu:
Thanks. Now, you'd better return the seasons to normal, okay?

Okina:
...I see. She's hinting to me that she knows what I'm up to...?
Pretending that I was searching for successor servants and making a big show of things seems to have paid off, in the end.
It seems that the Gensokyo we all created is still functioning just fine.
Honestly, it seems to be functioning too well, to the point where nobody can fully control it...
But that, too, is what the sages wanted for it.

Reimu:
Um...
You said 40th from the right, but did you mean my right, or yours?
Even up and down are kind of sketchy in here.

Okina:
Oh, sorry about that.
By now, the 16th door from my left would be your best bet...
How about I come with you, just to be safe?

Reimu:
Yes, please...

Okina:
While we're at it, why don't I join you for some drinks and a flower-viewing at the shrine?
Ah, we've got so much fun to look forward to...

Mai:
Oh, it's you again.

Satono:
It seemed like the master really enjoyed you. 
What a surprise!

Mai:
But your forward march ends here!

Cirno:
Door door door...
This place... 
I feel like I saw it before.
Is this that deja vu thing?

???:
Oh, you're the one from before.

Okina:
Aren't you an interesting fairy? 
I'm glad you made it.

Cirno:
Who're you?

Okina:
Whoa there. 
Huh? Did you forget?
Perhaps when I helped myself 
to the energy I had you gather,
you lost your memories with them?

Cirno:
Mmmm... 
Oh yeah!

Okina:
Do you remember now? 
Once again, welcome.

Cirno:
I just remembered that I came to this world 
to get my memories back!
So, uh, who're you again?

Okina:
This isn't getting us anywhere. 
Oh well, I suppose fairies (fools) will be fairies (fools) .
It is a shame though. When I saw such ambition in a fairy last time, 
I felt I had witnessed the beginning of a new era of fairies.

Cirno:
Hey, I'm gettin' the feeling you're making fun of me.

Okina:
It's not just your imagination. 
The fool before me is nothing but a disappointment.
I'll just take the magic from the door on your back 
and forcibly send you back to where you came from.

Cirno:
Yeah, you wanna fight? 
Come at me whenever you want!

Okina:
Hm? ...What is this? 
The season in your back is...
It doesn't belong to any of the four seasons?
To think it would be doyou, the border between seasons 
where the lifeforce of fairies is lost.

Okina:
Heh heh heh. 
I was nearly fooled by your idiot act.
You really are an interesting fairy. 
Shall we battle once more?

Cirno:
Ah! I remember now! 
The person I wanted to fight again
was someone sitting in a chair! 
Nothing to do with YOU! Outta the way!

Okina:
I'm the one who was in the chair! 
Can't you tell by looking?
But if you wanted a rematch with me, 
then let's do this.
For the true power of a hidden god, 
you had better savor every last drop!

Cirno:
I win! 
My long road to becoming the strongest is finally over!

Okina:
Splendid! 
Simply magnificent!
You're the first fairy to have 
achieved such mastery over the door on your back.
But I do have a question 
as to the way you fought.
You managed to outwit me by 
drawing power from the gap between seasons,
But it seems to be that 
you were not particularly aware of this.

Cirno:
Door on my back? 
Gap between seasons? What are you even talking about?
I won, you lost! 
That's it!

Okina:
Hm, she doesn't seem to be acting.
So you really are just a fairy (fool) then.
So was your use of the gap between seasons just a coincidence? 
Or perhaps...

Cirno:
Like I said, what's with all this season gap stuff?

Okina:
When one season transitions into another, there exists a moment 
that belongs to neither spring, summer, fall, or winter.
In that moment, the power of nature weakens, 
and mental energy wins out over life energy.
And for whatever reason, you chose to challenge me with 
that moment--the worst possible moment for a fairy.
Whether it was a coincidence or fate, that fact prevented me 
from stealing your power and forcibly ejecting you.
That's what at first surprised me, 
and then intrigued me.

Cirno:
Chose...?
But I didn't choose anything.

Okina:
Incidentally, which door did you enter from?

Cirno:
From one on Larva's back.
She's a swallowtail butterfly fairy.

Okina:
A swallowtail butterfly fairy, was it? 
I see...
Normally that should have been a summer door.
It's possible that she wasn't a butterfly fairy at all, 
but Tokoyo no Kami (God of the Everlasting Night) instead.
A god who is one of my enemies.
In which case, I can't imagine this was a coincidence.
But no matter. It doesn't change the fact that 
I discovered an interesting fairy.
So how about it? 
Would you like to try working for me?

Cirno:
Work? 
Why?

Okina:
I've been looking for a successor for 
my two servants.
All the job requires is that you dance and make a wild racket. 
There's no precedent, so perhaps even a fairy would do.

Cirno:
A job, huh?
I don't really wanna...
The only fairy jobs I've ever seen are ones 
where someone pushes them around like a slave.

Okina:
Well, think it over.
We have all the time in the world.

Mai:
What, you're back?

Satono:
We got the scolding of our lives 'cause of you!

Mai:
Begone this instant! 
You filthy tengu wretch!

Aya:
Hear me! 
I am known as the crow tengu of the gale, Aya Shameimaru!
I have come to challenge you to another battle 
with the future of the tengu at stake!
God of hindrances, Okina! 
Show yourself!

???:
The tengu from before?

Okina:
You must certainly be a bold one 
to appear before me again.

Aya:
Last time you escaped thanks to your cowardly trap, 
but this time you won't get away.

Okina:
I won't get away? 
What are you saying? Aren't YOU the one who fled?
After I had you return the power on your back, 
you were rendered completely helpless.
That's when you entered the door on your back 
and returned to your own world.
You're the one who ran.

Aya:
...I had a slight suspicion that might be the case.
I should have been fighting you, but before I knew it 
I was back in Gensokyo.
All the seasonal magic I'd gathered 
was taken by you and forcibly released.
And that itself was a trap to forcibly eject me. 
I should've known!

Okina:
Indeed, and that's why you'll never win! 
No matter how many times you try, you'll meet the same end.

Aya:
Hmph. Did you really think that, having figured all 
that out, I'd charge back in here without a plan?

Okina:
Oh? 
A plan, you say?

Aya:
Take a look at my back!

Okina:
Oho... I see! 
You came here with the power of the gap between seasons?

Aya:
Exactly. 
I only collected power from the turning point of the seasons.
The gap between seasons, where the vitality of the four seasons is lost, 
and where all the evil in the world rears its head!

Okina:
Heh heh. So if I absorb and release that, 
I'll destroy myself with the tengu's evil power.
But if you had stayed quiet, I might not have realized. 
Why tell me?

Aya:
I figured that a god such as yourself 
would be sure to figure it out anyway.
And I'm not here to destroy you, either.
I don't want to ensnare you in some cowardly trap. 
I just wanted to nullify the one you used.

Okina:
Heh heh heh. 
So you wish to fight fair and square, is it?
Very well then. To honor your courage, 
I won't use any seasonal energy.

Aya:
It's less that I want a fair match, 
and more that I just want to interview you.
You're a god of hindrances who shares 
an ancestor with us tengu, after all.
I'd like to know more about the history of outcasts from society 
such as yourself and what you're going to do in the future.

Okina:
Very well. If you win, I'll give you 
an interview and whatever else.
After all, Gensokyo's origins cannot be told of 
without including us beings of hindrance as well.
See it! Hear it! Speak of it! 
Behold the true form of the hidden god of hindrances!

Aya:
*Pant* *Pant* 
Had enough yet?!

Okina:
Splendid! 
That's more than enough, I understand your strength now.
This is my loss.

Aya:
...No, it's my loss.
Without this magic at my back, 
I wouldn't have stood a chance against you.
And that power is ultimately yours. 
This fight was built on the basic assumption that 
I would be using that power. Now that I've seen that...
I can tell that I've been dancing on your palm 
from the very beginning.

Okina:
That's right. I could have closed your door at any time 
and drawn from another source of power.
But I decided not to. And it's your courage 
that I chose to honor by doing so.
Whether or not you were on my palm, 
that doesn't change the fact that you won.
Stand proud.

Aya:
Yeah, you're right... 
Yeah! Why SHOULDN'T I claim victory?
So, as promised, I'll be conducting 
my interview with you now!

Okina:
Oh, uh, yes.

Aya:
So, for starters, 
why did you do all this?
Oh and by "this" I mean the four seasons incident.

Okina:
I've been feeling like it's about time 
for me to release my two servants.
So I was looking for their successor.
In order to draw in candidates with 
potential from a wide area...
I had the two of them draw out the latent 
abilities of absolutely everybody.
The seasons simply appeared a bit strange because 
of the fairies' and divine spirits' latent power.

Aya:
I see. So, did you find a successor then?

Okina:
Nope, not yet. 
I do have plenty of candidates, though.
I suppose this can be the last time 
I use the back doors all over Gensokyo.
I'm sure my message has already been received.

Aya:
?? 
All right, next question.

Okina:
Hold on, how many questions are there?

Aya:
As many as I need.

Okina:
I'm tired after that battle. 
Can we do this another time?
Oh, I know! How about I go visit 
the home of all you tengu?
Now that I've seen you, I've become quite 
interested in the tengu of today.
And if the tengu will accept, 
why not forge a peace agreement?

Aya:
Fine, fine, that's all fine.
But you'd better promise me this:
Don't accept interviews from anyone but me!
I can't let anyone else get their 
hands on a scoop this big.

Okina:
Uh, sure...

Mai:
Oh, it's you again?

Satono:
I heard you annoyed our Master.

Mai:
The test is over! Get outta here! Scram!

Marisa:
Hey! Anyone here?!

???:
So you've returned?

Okina:
You ran away in the middle of the final test. I'm sad to say you've been rejected.
Now leave, immediately.

Marisa:
I ran away during the test...? So that's really what happened, then?
At first I thought YOU had run away...
But when I thought it over, it did seem pretty likely that I had run myself.

Okina:
So what business does a coward like you have with me?

Marisa:
I came here for a rematch.
Not that I really care about the job or anything.
I just can't stand the thought of keeping this loss on my record!

Okina:
You're a human, but you do use magic, yes?
Then you should already understand.
You should know why you were rendered helpless and ultimately fled.

Marisa:
It was because all of that back equipment. It was used by you for both movement, and absorbing magic.
With those, you can get everything you want without lifting a finger.
So no matter what kind of human was using it, you could just drain all their energy.
And if you didn't need them, you could just send them flying to wherever.

Okina:
Exactly. In other words, you never stood a chance.
But even knowing all that, you still came for a rematch?

Marisa:
What, you think that's gonna stop me from reclaiming my victory?
This time I'm taking your trap and turning it around.

Okina:
Oh...? And what could you mean by that?

Marisa:
Take a look at my back! There's your answer!

Okina:
Oho... I see that the door on your back right now...
corresponds to doyou, the border between seasons where the world loses its vitality entirely.

Marisa:
How's THAT?
With this, even if you tried to kick me out, there's nowhere for me to go!

Okina:
Heh heh heh.
I don't think it'll work out very well in the end, but it's not a bad plan.

Marisa:
This time, I can get a fair fight outta ya with no worries at all!

Okina:
How interesting!
I'd already rejected you, but you've made me reconsider.
I must admit I'm quite taken by your wisdom and boldness. You can consider your rejection nullified.
Now let us begin the final test, once again!
This time I won't be using the energy of the seasons! Behold the the true secret arts of a hidden god!

Marisa:
C'mon! I've won by now, haven't I?!

Okina:
Splendid! You've passed the test!

Marisa:
Whew, that was tough. But I made it through, somehow.
Now I can get a good night's sleep with no worries at all...

Okina:
So with that, you have the job! I'll allow you to work for me.
So which one would you prefer to be? Teireida in charge of life energy, or Nishida in charge of mental energy?
Right now, you can have your pick of either.

Marisa:
I'm not gonna work for you. Didn't I say that already?
But, uh, if I DID, what would happen to those two?

Okina:
If you take over, I intend to release them and make them human again.
Although if you don't take the job, they'll remain as they are forever.

Marisa:
So they're both puppets being moved by your magic, huh...?
Well, I still don't wanna take their place. Nooo siree.
All that aside, do you think you could stop the 'four seasons' incident now?
If the forest stays winter any longer, I don't even wanna think about my heating bill.

Okina:
The four seasons incident is a side effect of the back doors.
But I suppose this can be the last time I use the doors all over Gensokyo.
I'm sure my message has already been received.

Marisa:
Huh? Message to who?

Okina:
Everyone living in Gensokyo, especially the other sages.

Marisa:
So, basically, you were showing off how strong you are?
Yeesh, talk about self-centered.

Okina:
You do realize that gods are required to do that, don't you?

Marisa:
Ah, right. We do have more than a few folks like that.
Well, whatever. The incident is gonna settle down now, right?
There wasn't any major damage, so I'll let you off with that.
In exchange, just tell everyone that I'm the one who resolved it, okay?

Okina:
Wuh-oh. Showing off how strong you are, eh?

Marisa:
That's right. Got a problem with that?

Okina:
Nope, none. None at all, but...
It's just, ehh... never mind.
In any case, I'll be be patiently awaiting your change of heart.

Marisa:
I told you, I'm not taking the job.
Plus, it's kinda creepy how quickly you changed your tone when you lost.

Narration:
First President of the Secret Sealing Club, Sumireko Usami.
A high school girl with psychic powers who can visit Gensokyo in her dreams.
On a usual Sunday night, She went to bed, with a slice of depression...
An unusual place, An unusual Reimu, In a mysterious dream, repeating itself over and over. She can't hide her confusion.

Sumireko:
...This dream again?
I'm in a weird place, Reimers is acting weird, it's an all-around uncanny dream.

Reimu:
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna come at me?

Sumireko:
And I've heard this exchange how many times by now?
Ugh, what do I have to do to get away from this dream...?

Reimu:
Stop your whining and come at me already.
You lowly coward!

Sumireko:
Well, at least her attacks aren't much to worry about...
I just wanna wake up from this weird dream soon.

Reimu:
What's the matter?

Sumireko:
Uuuuugh, this dream again...

Reimu:
Aren't you gonna come at me? Lowly coward.

Sumireko:
Gah! Fine, whatever! I don't even care anymore!
If I'm gonna keep having the same dream, then you bet I'll make the most of it!
I'm gonna record all of this and then post it to social media.
I'm gonna get all the likes!
...... Assuming I get to wake up, of course.

Narration:
You've unlocked your psychic power! 
Level 1 "Bullet Cancel" 
is now available!
"Bullet Cancel" 
When you take a photo of bullets, 
they will disappear like magic! Wow!
Well, time to take all of those intensive patterns 
and raise your view count sky high!

Remember if you shoot down the boss without 
taking any photos, it will not count as a clear 
and will not be written in the diary. 
Be aware that bosses don't have to be in 
the photos in order to clear.
None shall escape from the might of 
social network exposures!

Narration:
Take at least one photo before you shoot the boss! 
You can't escape from this strange dream if you don't do so!

Remember if you shoot down the boss without taking 
any photos, it will not count as a clear and 
will not be written in the diary.
Be aware that bosses don't have to be in the photos in order to clear.

Narration:
Perhaps because taking photos was the key to breaking the loop, 
she woke up from that unending, mysterious dream.
Her smartphone album 
was filled with unrealistic, mysterious 
photos of countless orbs (danmaku) . 
She resolved to publish these photos on social networks, 
and become the world's best danmaku photographer.
Though it had started as a typical, depressing Monday morning, 
she could feel her heart becoming just a bit lighter.
This game 
is a diary of the mysterious 
dreams that she experienced.
Of course, it would naturally be a Nightmare Diary...

Marisa:
Whoa, never thought I'd run into you in a place like this.

Sumireko:
Oh, thank goodness. You seem normal.

Marisa:
Great, that's great.
I can't believe you came to a place like this of your own will.
Now you can fight all you want.

Sumireko:
Huh?

Marisa:
C'mon, hit me with everything you've got! Otherwise, you'll never get out of here!

Sumireko:
You weren't normal after all!

Narration:
You have reached a new ESP level! 
Level 2 "Teleportation" is now available!
You may teleport in a fixed distance 
if you double tap the low-speed button!

When you tap low-speed key twice and then hold it 
without pressing any arrow keys, 
you'll be able to see where you'll be landing. 
You may then input the desired direction to teleport.

Narration:
Dodge those mean lasers 
with your teleportation ability!
You may teleport in a fixed distance 
if you double tap the low-speed button!

When you tap the low-speed key twice and then hold it 
without pressing any arrow keys, 
you'll be able to see where you'll be landing. 
You may then input the desired direction to teleport.

Doremy:
You there! The poor, lost dreamer.
Where do you think you're going?

Sumireko:
You... you're Doremy! Didn't you say you were the ruler of dreams?
Gensokyo's seemed pretty violent lately, but...
What the heck's going on?

Doremy:
This is the dream world seen by the people of Gensokyo.

Sumireko:
The dream world seen by the people of Gensokyo...?

Doremy:
It's not a dream someone of the outside world like you normally sees, but...
I'm sure you've been bringing too much reality into your own dream world.
Due to that, dreams and reality are becoming intermingled.

Sumireko:
What does that mean? What's going to happen to me?

Doremy:
You poor thing...

Sumireko:
Wh-What's with that reaction...?

Doremy:
You poor thing...

Doremy:
I suppose I can't simply end things for you here. You poor thing...

Sumireko:
Wh-What...?

Doremy:
From here on out, you'll continue to encounter the innocent malice of the dream dwellers.
As for how to escape this nightmare... It's impossible.

Sumireko:
Whaaaat?!
No way, that sucks... My dreams lately have been just exhausting.

Doremy:
Going forward, you'll attract more and more malice.
You will witness nightmares that would never occur in reality.
An endless nightmare...
You poor thing... Live strong.

Sumireko:
...Whaaat? This dream again? I'm already sick of meeting Reimers here.
I hate how I can't even hold a conversation with these dream dwellers.

Reimu:
Oh, so you've already realized that I'm a dream dweller?
That makes this simple.
Among the dream dwellers...
There are some who don't like you.
Thus, we've made a group decision on what to do with you.
Rejoice!
Every day from now on, you'll be attacked by dream dwellers baring their fangs!
This dream will be your last! You'll never see another Sunday again!

Sumireko:
All the dream dwellers decided that?
No way...

Doremy:
Hey there! I see you're still all right.

Sumireko:
I'm not all right! These dreams have been way too dangerous lately.
Hey, is it true that all the dream dwellers hate me?
The dream Reimers told me they all saw me as an enemy.

Doremy:
Well, she's not wrong. There might be some hostility.
That's why you're seeing these nightmares every night.

Sumireko:
Fuhee...

Doremy:
Everyone's jealous of your flesh and blood body.
Although to you, that might become a matter of life or death...

Sumireko:
So what's gonna happen to me now?

Doremy:
Poor soul... You'll just have to try not to die.
Even if you do die though, it's none of my concern.

Sumireko:
What do you mean by that?

Doremy:
Your other self will simply gain a body and wake up as if nothing ever happened.
To me... it doesn't really matter either way.

Sumireko:
Haa...Haa... Are you actually...

Doremy:
I just told you, didn't I? It doesn't matter to me who dies here.
Whether you are strong enough to defeat each and every nightmare,
Or you are so weak that the other Sumireko is released.

Sumireko:
You mean that nobody would even notice if I died in dreams?
Th-This is crazy! You're all nuts!
......
Heh heh heh.
I'm getting fired up! Nightmares aren't scary if you know the reason for them!
I'll show you the power of Sumireko Usami! The matchless, unparalleled psychic!

Okina:
Ha ha ha! How entertaining!
I've followed your previous battles, and for a human you've done quite admirably.

Sumireko:
Am I supposed to know who you are?
Not that I mind the compliments.

Okina:
But I have to say, simply overcoming nightmares like how you've been...
...won't improve your situation. You'll be facing down the same nightmares for eternity.

Sumireko:
Whaaat.

Okina:
But I might be able to save you, if you wanted me to, of course.

Sumireko:
Really? You can do that?

Okina:
Absolutely. You'll need to hold out a little longer, though.

Sumireko:
I'll do whatever you want, as long as it ends this nightmare.
Pleeease. Do something!

Okina:
Alright then.
If you manage to win against me, I'll lend you some back power.
Now come at me, you promising young human!

Okina:
Marvelous! Very well then!
I'll grant you some inverted vitality, on top of your psychic abilities.

Sumireko:
Ooh... So what can I do now?

Okina:
With this power, you'll be able to summon even more terrifying nightmares.

Sumireko:
Wait, what? Why would I want that?

Okina:
Because now you'll be able to see nightmares that you normally wouldn't.

Sumireko:
Did you just trick me into this?

Okina:
Don't rush to judgement. There's a reason.
The dream dwellers won't be satisfied until you overcome every last one of them.

Sumireko:
Every single nightmare...

Okina:
Oh, but you needn't worry.
With the new power you've earned, you should be able to weather even a true nightmare.
If you can't, well... that'll just be the end of you.

Sumireko:
The nightmares you can't normally see... What exactly are they?
Oh well, if that's the only way! Anything to end this nightmare!

Doremy:
Unbelievable. I can't believe you made it this far.

Sumireko:
Well if I didn't I'd be done, so I did!

Doremy:
The dream dwellers are starting to acknowledge your strength.
I don't think there's anyone who would think about burying you here anymore.

Sumireko:
Phew, that's good to hear.

Doremy:
However...
I, personally, haven't acknowledged you yet.
It may still be possible to deal with you in the dream world.

Sumireko:
I didn't catch that. What did you just say?

Doremy:
I may not outmatch you, but here I come. En garde!

Sumireko:
I knew you were behind everything! But I don't fear anything anymore!
Bring it on!

Sumireko:
How's that? Ready to give up?

Doremy:
......
...Poor soul.
You would've died happy, by my hand, without knowing the painful truth.

Sumireko:
Excuse me?
Who...... are you?!

Narration:
to be continued...

Sumireko:
Who...... are you?!

Sumireko (Real):
How could you not know who I am?
Have you never looked in a mirror? Or even taken a selfie?

Sumireko:
What... what's going on?

Sumireko (Real):
But even so...
You dare to use my body to go on such a shameless rampage?
It's high time you gave it back!

Sumireko:
Wha-what are you talking about? Another me? What is all this?

Sumireko (Real):
What are you freaking out about?
It was you who exiled me out of my own body and screwed around everywhere!
It was all you! Sumireko Usami from the Dream World!

Sumireko:
Dr-Dream World?

Sumireko (Real):
Sheesh, you can't even tell the difference between dream and reality anymore?
Fine. I'll just have to do this by force.
Time to take back my real body!

Sumireko (Real):
You... You're good. No surprise, since you're me.
But that doesn't mean I've given up!
I have allies!

Narration:
to be continued...

Sumireko:
I'm... a resident of the Dream World?

Sumireko (Real):
We've been switched for three weeks.

Sumireko:
...
...Heh heh heh. I just remembered.
That's right, I AM the Dream Sumireko...

Sumireko (Real):
Now give back my body!

Sumireko:
Hmph, after all that trouble to get my body.
From now on, I'M Sumireko Usami, the ultimate high school girl!

Sumireko (Real):
Think I'd let you do that?
I have allies!
All those dream dwellers who've been jealous of you for getting out of the dream are my allies!
And among them, I'm getting help from someone who can get me back to reality!
Your fun ends here! Tonight, the nightmare ends!

Sumireko (Real):
What the... What are these psychic powers!?
The power to live even through death?
And the power to erase bullets with a camera...
I can't do that!
What exactly IS a dream dweller?

Sumireko:
Well, you see...
This power was given to me by another dream dweller.
And she will liberate me...

Narration:
to be continued...

Narration:
Surprise! The Sumireko Usami you've been controlling was actually a dream dweller!
Is the dream dweller finally going to take over...?
It was the moment when she was going for all or nothing. 
The mastermind showed up. 
The one who gifted Dream Sumireko Usami 
the mysterious power...

Okina:
I see, so you've finally met?
You must be the human who mixes dream with reality.

Sumireko (Real):
Wh-who are you!?

Okina:
My name is Okina Matara.
I'm the one who granted possibility to the dream you.

Sumireko (Real):
Hmmm?
So it was your fault that the dream me became stronger than me!
Unforgivable! You're going down, here and now!

Okina:
Slow down.
However, now that the real you has awoken,
I suppose it'd be unfair for me to show only one of you favor.

Sumireko (Real):
Are you giving me new powers too!?

Okina:
No, I'll just turn off her power.
Then it will be fair.

Sumireko (Real):
That's kinda disappointing, actually...

Okina:
Regardless, I will not intervene in your battle. This fight is yours alone!
Whoever wins is the real, genuine, Sumireko Usami!

Sumireko (Real):
Hey, wai-

Sumireko (Dream):
For the last three weeks, I have conquered countless nightmares!
There's no way I'll lose to you who's gone soft from your peaceful life!
After I crush you, I'll share everything on social media and live high on the high school life!

Sumireko (Real):
Hah, dream on! The original is always the original!
And I'm the original! I'm Sumireko Usami, the first president of the Secret Sealing Club!

Narration:
In this stage, you will be controlling Sumireko Usami from the reality.
Bullet Cancel and Death Cancel are no longer usable.
Defeat Dream Sumireko Usami with only your shots! Take back the reality that was once yours!

Sumireko:
It feels like something mysterious might happen...

Sumireko:
Mondays are so depressing. I hope I can at least have fun in my dreams.

Sumireko:
They say that Sazae-san used to air on Tuesdays, too...

Sumireko:
Your mind goes totally blank on Wednesdays. Just trudging through whatever tasks are in front of you.

Sumireko:
Thursdays are kind of quietly exciting. Maybe because Friday comes after?

Sumireko:
Friday at last! Here's hoping these long, weird dreams will die down soon, too.

Sumireko:
Saturday! The best day of the week! I feel totally great. No more nightmares for me!

Sumireko:
Let's see. I started having these strange dreams on Sunday night, one week ago.

Sumireko:
Ugh, so depressing. I wish there'd never be another Monday.

Sumireko:
If you don't check the TV, you kind of lose track of what day it is.

Sumireko:
It feels like there's a lot more "Wednesday such-and-such" names than other days of the week.

Sumireko:
I wonder why the hospitals have their day off on Thursday so often.

Sumireko:
Man, this week was sooo long. Friday nights are just the best.

Sumireko:
I'm getting pretty used to these nightmares. Not like I want to have them, of course.

Sumireko:
Wonder if I'll have more nightmares this week...? Well, let's see.

Sumireko:
I've been thinking about nothing but dreams... Who cares about some dumb Monday.

Sumireko:
What did I usually do in the middle of weekdays, anyway...?

Sumireko:
This is weird... All I'm thinking about is dreams, dreams, dreams.

Sumireko:
I wonder who I'll meet today.

Sumireko:
I can't remember what I used to dream about before nightmares any more, but oh well!

Sumireko:
So it's been another week... It ought to be over soon, yeah.

Sumireko:
There's still something left...! Something that even I forgot about!

Reimu:
Yep, there's beast spirits all over the place.
But I've got no time to waste floundering 
around in some place like this.

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Reimu:
The stones? 
They were in my way, so I kicked 'em over.

Eika:
How mean! 
The children worked so hard on those...

Eika:
Someone like you should just die! 
I'll stone you to death!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Reimu:
I'm heading for Hell.
I can't afford to have trouble in a place as 
measly as the entrance to the afterlife.

Eika:
Oh? 
You're going to Hell?
That sounds about right for someone like you.

Reimu:
Whatever you say.

Reimu:
It's taking me forever to reach the other side...

???:
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human 
in the Sanzu River (a place like this) .

???:
Are you looking to get dragged down by some savage fish?

Reimu:
Those horns... Are you an oni?

Urumi:
Well, yeah, somethin' like that.
If you want to turn back now, 
I can send you home safely...

Reimu:
I'm fine, thanks.
If it's just fish I'll have to deal with, I'll filet 'em no problem.

Urumi:
That so? Fine by me, then.

Urumi:
I won't hold back when I turn you into 
food for my beloved ancient fish!

Urumi:
Well, I guess you aren't just some lost traveler.

Reimu:
For your information, I'm headed to Hell! 
Crossing the river is just one step along that path.

Urumi:
A living person going to Hell...?
Just the thought of that makes me shudder.

Reimu:
Huh? 
Oh. I was sure you were a Hell oni.

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Reimu:
Who are you...?

Kutaka:
I am Kutaka. I watch over 
the border checkpoint of Hell.

Reimu:
Ah, so you're Hell's gatekeeper. 
Well, that makes things simple.
I'm trying to go in there. 
Mind letting me through?

Kutaka:
Huhuhu.
Well, the Yama did say that 
it's okay to let you through.
But I would hate to do something 
as cruel as that, so...

Kutaka:
I'd like to politely request that 
you behave yourself and go home!

Kutaka:
W-Well done.
If you're that determined to go, 
then I won't keep you any longer.
Even if you end up burning in the flames of Hell, 
or if you get pierced by a bed of nails...
I'll forget all about you. 
I'm quite bird-brained, after all.

Reimu:
Are you actually a chicken, 
by any chance...?

Kutaka:
Indeed. 
You understand well.

Reimu:
Well, no, your appearance kinda tipped me off.

Kutaka:
Oh right, that reminds me. 
I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to 
trust that beast spirit possessing you.
And with that, please enjoy your time in Hell.

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

???:
You've done well to follow me.

Reimu:
Huff, huff... This wind is way too strong...
But now that I've finally found you, beast spirit, there's no way I'd let you escape.
I came down here to Hell in search of a beast spirit who's plotting to take over the surface world.
Would that happen to be you?

Yachie:
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast spirits you need to defeat...

Yachie:
Are not here in Hell.

Reimu:
Huh?
D-Don't think you can trick me just by spouting nonsense!

Yachie:
Heh heh heh. I'm not joking, I assure you. Shall I guide you to the enemy's location?

Reimu:
(What's going on...? I know she's gotta be lying.)
(But I feel like I have to believe her anyway...)

Yachie:
That settles it.
If you can beat me, I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

Yachie:
W-wonderful! With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the enemy you must defeat.

Reimu:
Who exactly are you?

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family. Do you really need any further explanation?

Reimu:
Huh? What the...?
Now that I think about it, I feel like I never had any questions...

Yachie:
Precisely.
You're just the human who came to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. Nothing more...

Reimu:
I'm not really satisfied, but... Just tell me the enemy's location already.

Yachie:
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm, located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Reimu:
In the center of the Animal Realm?! ...Got it! I'll do whatever I have to!

Yachie:
Just as dependable as I'd expect, oh warrior of Keiga, chosen by the wolves!
Now, go! Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Reimu:
So this is the Animal Realm...
It feels just as suffocating as Hell, but in a different sort of way.
So.
Is that the "structure in the center of the Animal Realm"...?

???:
A human?

???:
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste, or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

Reimu:
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Would that be the big keyhole thing behind you?

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in such a dog-eat-dog place as this?

Reimu:
For your information, I'm not from here.
I came from the surface world to exterminate the beast spirits, and...
......
(Gah, something's taking over my mind! ...Is this the wolf spirit's doing?!)

Reimu (Wolf):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... Could you be a wolf spirit?
To think that a wolf would be smart enough to rely on a living human...

Reimu (Wolf):
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance with that loathsome Kiketsu Family!
I shall liberate the human spirits (our prey) from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-so strong! So this is what living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Reimu (Wolf):
(Yes! I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks, human shrine maiden!)

Reimu:
.....
The beast spirit's taking over my mind?! What on earth is going on...?

Reimu (Wolf):
(Sorry about that. It's me, the wolf spirit.)
(But thanks to you, we can gain entry to the Primate Spirit Garden.)
(Just a little further...!)
(Just a little further, and we beast spirits can take back control of the Animal Realm.)
(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(Worry not. Our objectives are the same.)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Reimu:
...What am I even fighting against right now?
Whatever, though. Let's go!
To what is (probably) the enemy's main base!

Mayumi:
To think that living humans were such strong creatures!
This reality is just like a dream!

Reimu:
Man, it's gross in here.
So, oh wolf spirit possessing me, where's the enemy we're searching for?

Reimu (Wolf):
(....)
(W-what is all this?!)
(The Garden was so full of nature, but now... I'll never forgive those curs!)

???:
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact that nobody was left to fight against us...

Reimu (Wolf):
I've finally found you!
The god of destruction who broke the laws of animal-kind! Keiki Haniyasushin!
I brought a live human along to destroy your idols!

Keiki:
A live human?!
That's ridiculous... Who would believe that?

Reimu:
T-they're not lying! I'm a human from the surface!
Who are you? What is this place?

Keiki:
Ahahah! I see. You certainly do seem to be a human.
But what exactly do you hope to accomplish...
By tricking and dragging along some foolish human who doesn't know anything? Care to answer, wolf spirit?

Reimu (Wolf):
.....

Keiki:
You're a wolf from the Keiga Family, right? Useless for everything except biting?

Reimu (Wolf):
...How'd you know?

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
You there, human. Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

Reimu:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola Deus) who protects the human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other. Don't you agree?

Reimu:
F-fellow humans...?!

Reimu (Wolf):
Don't be fooled, shrine maiden!
She's a wicked god who destroyed the divine blessing of Nature!
She's an enemy of beasts and humans both!

Reimu:
U-urgh... I feel like I've gotten dragged into something really obnoxious.
But I can see an evil aura around you! I'll beat you for starters, and then think things over!

Keiki:
Ah. Your intuition certainly isn't very sharp.
I'm saying that I'll let you off the hook if you back off now, but you didn't notice at all...
What a shame. What a crying shame...

Reimu (Wolf):
(Human, this is bad! We let her stall for too long!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Reimu (Wolf):
We must retreat for now! RUN!

Keiki:
You built up this whole plan, and now you flee in the face of the enemy...! Truly the height of idiocy.
Don't think for a second that I'll let you escape after you violated my sacred territory to this extent.
I'll destroy your body of flesh, and build you anew from soil and water!
You shall be an idol without a single flaw, told of for ages and ages to come!

Reimu (Wolf):
You've done well to survive this long, human! Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now! Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Reimu:
Yep, there's beast spirits all over the place.
But I've got no time to waste floundering 
around in some place like this.

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Reimu:
Oh, I'm so sorry. 
I didn't notice them.

Eika:
The stone-stacking contest is ruined now...

Eika:
You won't be thrashing around any more 
once I'm through with you!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Reimu:
Sorry about that. 
I'm really just passing by.
I have no interest in you.

Eika:
Well, that's...
Also kind of mean...? 
How awful...

Reimu:
It's taking me forever to reach the other side...

???:
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human 
in the Sanzu River (a place like this) .

???:
Are you looking to get dragged down by some savage fish?

Reimu:
Buh. Who're you?

Urumi:
I'm an ushi-oni. 
I live by the River.
If you want to turn back now, 
I can send you home safely...

Reimu:
I'd rather you send me to Higan 
and not home, if you don't mind...

Urumi:
That so? 
Welp, if that's what you want, then so be it.

Urumi:
I'll send you there (kill you) 
just like you asked!

Urumi:
Dang, you're strong.
Kind of a shame, really. I thought I could 
turn you into food for my ancient fish.

Reimu:
Sorry, I don't feel like losing to some youkai.

Urumi:
Higan's only a little further past here.
I'll ferry ya over there in place of the boatman. 
But you'd better have some good stories for me when you get back, a'ight?

Reimu:
Deal! 
Thank you.

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Reimu:
Who are you...?

Kutaka:
I am Kutaka. I watch over 
the border checkpoint of Hell.

Reimu:
So you're some sort of... gatekeeper?
I kinda have to get into Hell. 
How would I go about that?

Kutaka:
Well, the Yama did say that 
it's okay to let you through.
But I never had any intention of letting you pass.

Reimu:
Whaaat? 
Aw man.
Even I'm not that thrilled about going there, 
but I'm doing my best to power through it, you know...!

Kutaka:
Exactly. Such a weak-willed human 
would be eaten by oni in an instant.

Kutaka:
I cannot allow such a tragedy to happen. 
Behave yourself, now, and go home!

Kutaka:
F-for someone so timid, 
you certainly are strong...

Reimu:
I've got, like, zero good memories of Hell, 
so I honestly don't wanna go there at all...
But this is part of my job too, 
so y'know, what choice do I have?

Kutaka:
I don't think you'll have much trouble, 
judging by the power you have...
But you can't keep that weak mindset.
The spirits of Hell will sneak into your heart 
as soon as they find an opening.
Speaking of which, I see that your heart's 
already been possessed by a beast spirit.
If you want to survive very long, 
you'd best keep your wits about you...

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

Yachie:
You've done well to follow me.

Reimu:
Huff, huff... This wind is way too strong...
But now that I've finally found you, beast spirit, there's no way I'd let you escape.
I came down here to Hell in search of a beast spirit who's plotting to take over the surface world.
Would that happen to be you?

Yachie:
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast spirits you need to defeat...

Yachie:
Are not here in Hell.

Reimu:
Eh?
I-Is that true?

Yachie:
Indeed it is. Shall I guide you to the enemy's location?

Reimu:
(What's going on...?)
(I'm getting the feeling that she's speaking the truth...)

Yachie:
That settles it.
If you can beat me, I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

Yachie:
W-wonderful! With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the enemy you must defeat.

Reimu:
Who exactly are you?

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu family. There's no way you don't know what that means.

Reimu (Otter):
M-My sincerest apologies, Lady Kicchou!

Reimu:
(Huh? What the...? Why am I apologizing?)

Yachie:
There's no need to apologize.
You're just the human who came to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. Nothing more...

Reimu:
Yeah, it feels like you're telling the truth. Why is that...?

Yachie:
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm, located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Reimu:
The center of the Animal Realm, huh? All right! We've got the enemy's location!

Yachie:
Now, oh sneak attacker, chosen by the otters! 
Remember the iron-clad law of the Kiketsu Family!
There is no route swifter or more effective than the rear! 
Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Reimu:
So this is the Animal Realm...
It feels just as suffocating as Hell, but in a different sort of way.
So.
Is that the "structure in the center of the Animal Realm"...?

???:
A human?

???:
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste, or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

Reimu:
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Would that be the big keyhole thing behind you?

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:

You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! You're a flesh-and-blood human!

......
(Gah, something's taking over my mind! ...Is this the otter spirit's doing?!)

Reimu (Otter):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... Could you be an otter spirit?

Reimu (Otter):
That's right! Now, face the elite 
underhanded tactics of the Kiketsu Family!

Mayumi:
Ah, I see. You're an agent of Kicchou, from the Kiketsu Family.

Reimu (Otter):
I shall liberate the human spirits (our tools) from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-so strong! So this is what living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Reimu (Otter):
(Yes! I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks, human shrine maiden!)

Reimu:
.....
The beast spirit's taking over my mind?! What on earth is going on...?

Reimu (Otter):
(It's me, the otter spirit. Once again, thank you.)
(With your help, we'll be able to destroy those idols!)
(But I need your cooperation for just a little longer.)
(Once the idols are destroyed, we beast spirits will take back control of the Animal Realm.)
(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(That means we have the same goal, right? Let's join forces and take them down!)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Reimu:
...What am I even fighting against right now?
Well, it doesn't feel like the otter spirit is lying, either.
So let's go! To that "Primate Spirit Garden" place!

Mayumi:
To think that living humans were such strong creatures!
This reality is just like a dream!

Reimu:
Man, it's gross in here.
So, oh otter spirit possessing me, where's the enemy we're searching for?

Reimu (Otter):
(....)
(This was always the most beautiful garden in the entire Animal Realm...)
(I'd heard the rumors, sure, but this really is atrocious.)

???:
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact that nobody was left to fight against us...

Reimu (Otter):
There you are!
The god of destruction who broke the laws of animal-kind! Keiki Haniyasushin!
The time has come for your ambitions to be crushed!

Keiki:
Oh, that's good to hear. Animals ought to be nice and lively, after all!
I can smell that particular fishy scent of the Kiketsu Family coming off of you.

Reimu (Otter):
...?!

Keiki:
But you look like a human, though... 
Just what kind of cowardly scheme did you come up with?

Reimu:
Woah, woah, wait! I'm human!
Who are you? And what is this place?

Keiki:
...?!
I see... you possessed a human.
But what exactly do you hope to accomplish...
By tricking and dragging along some foolish human who doesn't 
know anything? Kiketsu Family's... otter spirit, I believe?

Reimu (Otter):
(...She's not afraid of live humans?!)
(Lady Kitchooou! That's not what you told meeee!)

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
You there, human. Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

Reimu:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola Deus) who protects the human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other. Don't you agree?

Reimu:
F-fellow humans...?!

Reimu (Otter):
Don't be fooled, shrine maiden!
She's a wicked god who only sucks up faith from the human spirits!
She's an enemy of beasts and humans both!

Reimu:
U-urgh... I feel like I've gotten dragged into something really obnoxious.
But I can see an evil aura around you! I'll beat you for starters, and then think things over!

Keiki:
Ah. Your intuition certainly isn't very sharp.
I'm saying that I'll let you off the hook if you back off now, but you didn't notice at all...
What a shame. What a crying shame...

Reimu (Otter):
(T-this is bad! We took too much time, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Reimu (Otter):
We must retreat for now! RUN!

Keiki:
You built up this whole plan, and now you flee in the face of the enemy...! Truly the height of idiocy.
Don't think for a second that I'll let you escape after you violated my sacred territory to this extent.
I'll destroy your body of flesh, and build you anew from soil and water!
You shall be an idol without a single flaw, told of for ages and ages to come!

Reimu (Otter):
You've done well to survive this long, human! Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now! Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Reimu:
Yep, there's beast spirits all over the place.
But I've got no time to waste floundering 
around in some place like this.

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Reimu:
What's that? You dare blame me?
It's YOUR fault for stacking pebbles 
on the riverside, of all places!

Eika:
Y-You...!

Eika:
How dare you mock the art of stone-stacking! 
Unforgivable! Dieee!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Reimu:
You should feel honored.
Thanks to me gathering all the beast spirits, 
you can stack stones to your heart's content.

Eika:
We would've been stacking them from the 
very beginning if you hadn't come along...
Today's stone-stacking contest 
is completely ruined!

Reimu:
It's taking me forever to reach the other side...

???:
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human 
in the Sanzu River (a place like this) .

???:
Are you looking to get dragged down by some savage fish?

Reimu:
Ah, you showed up at the perfect time.
This river is so unnecessarily vast 
that I lost track of where I'm going.

Urumi:
Are you saying you want me to guide you?
...Heh heh heh. All right, fine. 
But I'll choose the destination for you.
Would you rather return to Gensokyo? 
Or perhaps...

Urumi:
Would you like me to send you 
to the world beyond, after all?!

Urumi:
Whoa, that's some power all right.

Reimu:
Sending me to the world beyond? Pah.
I'm going even further beyond that, 
for your information! To Hell!

Urumi:
You wanna go to Hell?
What a frightenin' thing to say...

Reimu:
I have no business with those who lack 
the courage to go there. Begone.

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Reimu:
Are you perhaps trying to test me? 
Who are you, anyway?

Kutaka:
I am Kutaka. I watch over 
the border checkpoint of Hell.
The Yama did say that it's 
okay to let you through...
But I don't believe you're ready 
to go through Hell just yet.

Reimu:
Hah hah. Ridiculous!
Who do you think I am? I can't deal with Hell? 
Say that after you take a good stab at me!

Kutaka:
How very assertive. 
I should expect as much from a potential Hell visitor.

Kutaka:
Very well. I'll test you to your 
limits, just as you wish!

Kutaka:
W-Well done.
With such skill, you may even be able 
to compete with the oni in Hell.

Reimu:
My, how kind of you to tell me 
something that I already knew.

Kutaka:
Oh right, that reminds me. 
I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to 
trust that beast spirit possessing you.

Reimu:
Huh? 
What's that supposed to mean?

Kutaka:
I find myself wondering the same thing. 
I forget things almost right away, you see...

Reimu:
Y-you know, now that I take a good look at you... 
Are you literally a birdbrain?

Kutaka:
Of course I am. I'm a chicken deity, after all. 
Being birdbrained is a valuable trait of mine!
And with that, please enjoy your time in Hell.

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

???:
You've done well to follow me.

Reimu:
Huff, huff... This wind is way too strong...
But now that I've finally found you, beast spirit, there's no way I'd let you escape.
I came down here to Hell in search of a beast spirit who's plotting to take over the surface world.
Would that happen to be you?

Yachie:
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast spirits you need to defeat...

Yachie:
Are not here in Hell.

Reimu:
Huh?
No way. You're just trying to trick me, aren't you?

Yachie:
If you don't believe me, then fine.
Feel free to wander forever in Hell's infinitely vast space.

Reimu:
Uh, er. I guess I could hear you out just a little?

Yachie:
Heh heh. That settles it, then.
If you can beat me, I'll tell you where your real enemy is.

Yachie:
W-wonderful! With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
I will now guide you to the enemy you must defeat.

Reimu:
Who exactly are you?

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family. Do you really need any further explanation?

Reimu:
Huh? What the...?
Now that I think about it, I feel like I never had any questions...

Yachie:
Precisely.
You're just the human who came to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. Nothing more...

Reimu:
Alright, then spit it out already. I'm not quite sure why, but I want to get there in a hurry...

Yachie:
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm, located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Reimu:
So the enemy's in the center of the Animal Realm!
Yeesh, you could've just told me that from the get-go.

Yachie:
Warrior of Gouyoku, chosen by the eagles! I trust that you're not just talk!
Now, go! Destroy that demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Reimu:
So this is the Animal Realm...
It feels just as suffocating as Hell, but in a different sort of way.
So.
Is that the "structure in the center of the Animal Realm"...?

???:
A human?

???:
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste, or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

Reimu:
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Would that be the big keyhole thing behind you?

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in such a dog-eat-dog place as this?

Reimu:
For your information, I'm not from here.
I came from the surface world to exterminate the beast spirits, and...
......
(Gah, something's taking over my mind! ...Is this the eagle spirit's doing?!)

Reimu (Eagle):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... Could you be an eagle spirit?
To think that an eagle would be so humble as to rely on a living human...

Reimu (Eagle):
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance with that loathsome Kiketsu Family!
I shall liberate the human spirits (slaves) from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-so strong! So this is what living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Reimu (Eagle):
(Yes! I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks, human shrine maiden!)

Reimu:
.....
The beast spirit's taking over my mind?! What on earth is going on...?

Reimu (Eagle):
(It's me. The eagle spirit.)
(With the two of us combined, we can take back the Animal Realm!)
(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(That should sound pretty good to you too, no?)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Reimu:
...What am I even fighting against right now?
Still, I can feel a creepy cult aura up ahead, like nothing I've ever felt before!
Let's go! We're off to that "Primate Spirit Garden" place!

Mayumi:
To think that living humans were such strong creatures!
This reality is just like a dream!

Reimu:
Man, it's gross in here.
So, oh eagle spirit possessing me, where's the enemy we're searching for?

Reimu (Eagle):
(....)
(This is the interior of the Garden...?)
(It's filled with man-made material now...! What happened to the beautiful nature?!)

???:
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact that nobody was left to fight against us...

Reimu (Eagle):
So there you are, eh?
The god of destruction who broke the laws of animal-kind! Keiki Haniyasushin!
Your reign ends here!

Keiki:
God of destruction? Talk about rude.
In this eat-or-be-eaten Animal Realm, there's nobody else who's created as much as I have.

Reimu:
Hey, uh. Who are you, exactly?

Keiki:
Huh? You were acting like you knew me a second ago...
...Wait, are you a human?!

Reimu:
Yep, I'm human!
I thought I'd go exterminate the beast spirits, but somehow I wound up here.

Reimu (Eagle):
Silence, you!
This is my chance to defeat the wicked god standing before us.
For just this moment, I, the mighty eagle, shall be Reimu Hakurei!

Keiki:
I see... you possessed a human and brought them all the way here.
But what exactly do you hope to accomplish...
By tricking and dragging along some foolish human who doesn't know anything? Care to answer, eagle spirit?

Reimu (Eagle):
......

Keiki:
You're from the Gouyoku Alliance, right?
Famous for being ridiculously prideful, but lacking in capabilities in every other area...

Reimu (Eagle):
Hmph. But if I defeat you, I can steal the Animal Realm's top seat!
I heard that you're weak against living humans, too! Now, have at thee!

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
You there, human. Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

Reimu:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola Deus) who protects the human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other. Don't you agree?

Reimu:
F-fellow humans...?!

Reimu (Eagle):
Don't be fooled, shrine maiden!
She's no ally of humans at all.
She's a wicked god who drove the human spirits who summoned her to their destruction!

Reimu:
U-urgh... I feel like I've gotten dragged into something really obnoxious.
But I can see an evil aura around you! I'll beat you for starters, and then think things over!

Keiki:
Ah. Your intuition certainly isn't very sharp.
I'm saying that I'll let you off the hook if you back off now, but you didn't notice at all...
What a shame. What a crying shame...

Reimu (Eagle):
(Human, this is bad! We let her stall for too long!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Reimu (Eagle):
We must retreat for now! RUN!

Keiki:
You built up this whole plan, and now you flee in the face of the enemy...! Truly the height of idiocy.
Don't think for a second that I'll let you escape after you violated my sacred territory to this extent.
I'll destroy your body of flesh, and build you anew from soil and water!
You shall be an idol without a single flaw, told of for ages and ages to come!

Reimu (Eagle):
You've done well to survive this long, human! Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now! Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Marisa:
Lotta beast spirits here, huh?
Looks like they're coming from across the river, 
no doubt about it.

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Marisa:
The stones?
Those things basically exist to get knocked over.
I saved ya the trouble of havin' those little oni 
knock 'em over for ya. You should be thankin' me.

Eika:
Even the little oni don't knock them over one by one... 
You're worse than an oni!

Eika:
You oni!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Marisa:
You done already? 
Talk about boneless.

Eika:
Boneless...? 
You're talking to ME about BONES?!

Marisa:
W-What's wrong?

Eika:
Who... who cares if I don't have any bones!

Marisa:
This river's as creepy as always...

???:
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human 
in the Sanzu River (a place like this) .

Urumi:
Are you lost? 
This isn't a place for the living.

Marisa:
Perfect timing. 
You seem like the fun type.
I've lost the way to my destination, see, 
an' I'm a little ticked off.
I bet I'll feel way better 
once I beat you up!

Urumi:
Wow, talk about desperate...
I have to say, it's been a while 
since I last attacked a human...

Urumi:
As you wish, then! 
I'll turn you into food for my ancient fish!

Urumi:
Mrgh. You're strong.

Marisa:
A'ight, spit it out.
Which way to Higan?

Urumi:
Don't worry, 
we're pretty close to Higan already.
But if that's where you're headed...
Wouldn't it have been better 
to have the shinigami take you?

Marisa:
This is an emergency. 
I don't have time for a pleasure cruise!

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Marisa:
And who're you?

Kutaka:
I am Kutaka. I watch over 
the border checkpoint of Hell.
I've been testing you, 
to see if you're capable of withstanding Hell.

Marisa:
Oh? I'm sure you've seen enough, then. 
Lemme through.

Kutaka:
Hmm... not quite. 
At your level...
I doubt you'd even make it 
to the first ward of Hell.

Marisa:
Then stop it with the kiddy stuff, 
and hit me with some Hell-level attacks!
I'll dodge 'em all!

Kutaka:
Of course. That was the plan. 
I'll show you Hell before you even set foot inside!

Kutaka:
W-Well done.
Now I understand why the Yama 
said to give you permission.

Marisa:
I mean, I DID beat up the Yama (her) that one time.
So, next up is finally Hell, huh...?
I don't care how strong they are down there! 
I'll kick all their butts!

Kutaka:
Oh right, that reminds me. 
I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to 
trust that beast spirit possessing you.
And with that, please enjoy your time in Hell.

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

???:
You've done well to follow me.

Marisa:
Huff, huff...
Hell's winds sure take a toll on ya.
But I finally caught up to you!
You're the beast spirit who's trying to take over the surface!

Yachie:
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast spirit you are looking for is not me.

Yachie:
The beast spirit you see as your enemy, is not in Hell (here) .

Marisa:
Huh?
B-But the beast spirits are coming up from Hell......

Yachie:
This is because they had to pass through Hell to reach the Human Realm from the Animal Realm.
How about I guide you to your enemy?

Marisa:
T-Tell me more about that.

Yachie:
Then it's decided.
If you win against me then I'll tell you where your true enemy is.

Yachie:
W-wonderful! With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, I shall guide you to the enemy you must defeat.

Marisa:
Who exactly are you?

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family. Do you really need any further explanation?

Marisa:
Leader of the Kiketsu Family......?!
What the... I've only heard of them just now, but I already know her somehow...

Yachie:
You're the human who came to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. Nothing more...

Marisa:
I'm not really satisfied with that answer, but...... I guess it's fine as long as I can fight the enemy.

Yachie:
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm, located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Marisa:
The enemy's in the center of the Animal Realm, right!? I'm kinda getting excited now!

Yachie:
Truly reassuring as I'd expect! Oh warrior of Keiga, chosen by the wolves!
Go forth! Destroy the demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Marisa:
Whoa,
this place is very different from Hell back there.
Is that the "structure in the center of the Animal Realm"
that the person back there mentioned......?

???:
A human?

???:
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste, 
or you'll be captured by the starving beasts.

Marisa:
What's the Primate Spirit Garden?
Is it that Kofun I see over there? It's certainly a garden for spirits.

Mayumi:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in such a dog-eat-dog place?

Marisa:
I'm not a resident of this place.
I came here from the surface to exterminate the beast spirits, and......
......
(Ugh, I can't move!? ......it's the wolf spirit's doing!)

Marisa (Wolf):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... Could you be a wolf spirit?
To think that a wolf would be smart enough to rely on a living human...

Marisa (Wolf):
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance with that loathsome Kiketsu Family!
I shall liberate the human spirits (our prey) from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-so strong! So this is what living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Marisa (Wolf):
(Yes! 
I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks, 
human magician!)

Marisa:
......
To think that the wolf spirit would take over my body.

Marisa (Wolf):
(Sorry about that. It's me, the wolf spirit.)
(But thanks to you, we can gain entry to the Primate Spirit Garden.)
(Just a little further...!)
(Just a little further, and we beast spirits can take back control of the Animal Realm.)
(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(Worry not. Our objectives are the same.)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Marisa:
This has gotten serious.
But I've gotten this far, no reason to back off now!
I find out what's happening in the Animal Realm with my own two hands!

Mayumi:
To think that living humans were such strong creatures!
This reality is just like a dream!

Marisa:
So this is the inside of that Kofun......
This place is just weird on top of weird.
Wolf spirit, where's our enemy?

Marisa (Wolf):
(....)
(W-what is all this?!)
(The Garden was so full of nature, but now... I'll never forgive those curs!)

Keiki:
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact that nobody was left to fight against us...

Marisa (Wolf):
I've finally found you!
The god of destruction who broke the laws of animal-kind! Keiki Haniyasushin!
I brought a live human along to destroy your idols!

Keiki:
A live human?!
That's ridiculous... Who would believe that?

Marisa:
I'm sorry that I'm ridiculous. I'm the human.
Who are you?
I came here lead by all the beast spirits, but......

Keiki:
Ahahah! I see. You certainly do seem to be a human.
But what exactly do you hope to accomplish...
By tricking and dragging along some foolish human who doesn't know anything? Care to answer, wolf spirit?

Marisa (Wolf):
......

Keiki:
You're a wolf from the Keiga Family, right? Useless for anything except biting?

Marisa (Wolf):
...How'd you know?

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
You there, human. Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

Marisa:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola Deus) who protects the human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other. Don't you agree?

Marisa:
Huh? Are you human?

Marisa (Wolf):
Don't be fooled, magician.
She's a wicked god who destroyed the divine blessing of Nature!
She's an enemy of beasts and humans both!

Marisa:
Wh-what? I don't really get it.
Who's spitting lies here?

Keiki:
To trust in me or the beast spirit? I wonder why you hesitate?
I am a god that saved the humans who were being persecuted!
The beast spirit possessing you right now, is the enemy of mankind!
Well? Won't you join my side...?

Marisa (Wolf):
(T-this is bad! There's no time to lend her an ear, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! 
Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Marisa (Wolf):
We must retreat for now! RUN!

Keiki:
Even though you seemed like you had a plan... To escape right before your foe...
I'm disappointed! Beasts will be beasts after all.
That's it, I'll destroy this human's body of flesh, and build it anew from soil and water!
Humans from the surface are rare! I'll make you the best idol in the Animal Realm!

Marisa (Wolf):
You've done well to survive this long, human! Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now! Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Marisa:
Lotta beast spirits here, huh?
Looks like they're coming from across the river, 
no doubt about it.

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Marisa:
Huh? 
T-the stacked stones...?

Eika:
We were supposed to hold our stone-stacking contest today...
I won't forgive you!

Marisa:
Welp, this ain't good... 
I don't really wanna fight...

Eika:
Get out of this riverbank (here) ! Now!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Marisa:
Uh, sorry about that. 
I'm kinda in a hurry...

Eika:
*sob sob*
The children were looking forward 
to this contest so much...

Marisa:
Talk about a bad aftertaste... 
I-I'll come back when things calm down, okay?

Marisa:
This river's as creepy as always...

???:
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human 
in the Sanzu River (a place like this) .

Urumi:
Are you lost? 
This isn't a place for the living.

Marisa:
Sorry... 
I kinda lost track of where I was goin'.

Urumi:
Do you want to return to Gensokyo...?
Heh heh heh. 
What perfect timing.

Marisa:
Hm?

Urumi:
Feeding time for my ancient fish 
just rolled around.

Urumi:
Heh heh heh... Excuse me, but could 
you watch my baby for a moment?

Urumi:
Mrgh. You're strong.

Marisa:
What's up with that stone baby?
It was so heavy, I thought I might 
end up fallin' in the river.

Urumi:
You can hold it, even though it's so heavy...?!
Dang, you must be a lot 
stronger than you look.
Alright. 
I'll stop trying to drown you.

Marisa:
Oh, you were trying to drown me. Yikes.

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Marisa:
And who're you?

Kutaka:
I am Kutaka. I watch over 
the border checkpoint of Hell.

Marisa:
Ah, so you're Hell's gatekeeper.
Then would ya happen t' know 
what's goin' on in Hell?
Like, are the beast spirits tryin' 
to conquer the surface or somethin'?

Kutaka:
There's always some turmoil or 
another occuring in Hell.
Even violent power struggles 
are an everyday occurence...

Marisa:
B-but this time it looks like the surface's in trouble.
Is there any way you could let me into Hell?

Kutaka:
I'm well aware of your intent to go there. 
Therefore, I shall test your strength.

Kutaka:
After all, if you cannot even dodge my attacks, 
then visiting Hell would be futile.

Kutaka:
Th-That's enough. 
I've seen all I need to.
With strength like yours, you may very well 
be able to handle yourself in Hell.

Marisa:
That so? Phew. I was honestly kinda 
worried about goin' to Hell...
But I s'pose there wasn't any need to worry.

Kutaka:
Oh right, that reminds me. 
I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to 
trust that beast spirit possessing you.
Your heart, in particular, already seems 
to be falling under its control.
Take care not to get caught 
in one of Hell's schemes...

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

???:
You've done well to follow me.

Marisa:
Huff, huff...
Hell's winds sure take a toll on ya.
Anyways, what a plain and suspicious guy, 
I'm glad I found you.
You're the beast spirit 
who's trying to take over the surface!

Yachie:
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast 
spirit you are looking for is not me.

Yachie:
The beast spirit you see as your enemy,
is not in Hell (here) .

Marisa:
Huh?
B-But the beast spirits are 
coming up from Hell......

Yachie:
This is because they had to pass through Hell to reach 
the Human Realm from the Animal Realm.
How about I guide you to your enemy?

Marisa:
Now that you say that 
I do feel like you aren't my enemy......

Yachie:
I am no foe of yours.
If you win against me then 
I'll tell you where your true enemy is.

Yachie:
W-wonderful! 
With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, I shall guide you to the 
enemy you must defeat.

Marisa:
Who exactly are you?

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family. 
There's no way you don't know what that means.

Marisa (Otter):
M-My sincerest apologies, Lady Kicchou!

Marisa:
(Huh? What? 
Why am I apologizing?)

Yachie:
There's no need to apologize.
You're just the human who came 
to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. Nothing more...

Marisa:
T-That's true. 
I did come here to defeat them.

Yachie:
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm, 
located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure 
located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Marisa:
Center of the Animal Realm, got it! 
Welp, let's just give it a go!

Yachie:
Oh sneak attacker, chosen by the otters! 
Remember the iron-clad law of the Kiketsu Family!
There is no route swifter or more effective than the rear! 
Destroy the demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Marisa:
What even is this place?
Seems totally different from 
Hell back there.
Is that the "structure in the 
center of the Animal Realm"
that the person back there mentioned......?

???:
A human?
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste, 
or else you'll be captured by starving beasts.

Marisa:
What's the Primate Garden?
Do you mean that burial mound thing over there? 
It's certainly a garden for spirits.

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! 
You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in 
such a dog-eat-dog place?

Marisa:
I'm not a resident of this place.
I came here from the surface to 
exterminate the beast spirits, and......
...
(Ugh, why can't I move!? 
...Is the otter spirit doing this?!)

Marisa (Otter):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here 
just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... 
Could you be an otter spirit?

Marisa (Otter):
That's right! Now, face the elite 
underhanded tactics of the Kiketsu Family!

Mayumi:
Ah, I see. You're an agent of Kicchou, from the Kiketsu Family.

Marisa (Otter):
I shall liberate the human spirits (our tools) from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-So strong! Is this really what 
flesh and blood humans are like?
What a terrible menace...!

Marisa (Otter):
(Yes! 
At this rate, we'll win!)
(Thank you, 
human magician!)

Marisa:
...
Can't believe I let an otter 
spirit hijack my body.

Marisa (Otter):
(It's me, the otter spirit. 
Once again, thank you.)
(Thanks to you, we'll be able 
to destroy those idols.)
(I'd like it if you could 
cooperate just a little longer.)
(Once we defeat the idols, the animal spirits 
will once more rule the Animal Realm.)
(And if that happens, then the animal spirits 
will call off their invasion of the surface.)
(Your goal and mine are one and the same. 
Let's join forces and conquer!)

Mayumi:
For the first time since the construction of the haniwa 
soldiers, we have a state of emergency!
I've got to let everyone know!

Marisa:
Well, this has gotten pretty weird.
But whatever, I might as well 
believe you, otter spirit.
Alright, let's head to the Primate Garden!

Mayumi:
I never thought a flesh and blood human 
could be such a powerful creature!
It feels like a dream, but it's reality!

Marisa:
So this is what's inside the burial mound, huh...
Man, it just keeps getting more and more different.
Otter spirit, where's the enemy?

Marisa (Otter):
(...)
(The Primate Garden was said to be the 
most beautiful park in the Animal Realm...)
(I had heard rumors, but its 
current state is deplorable.)

???:
A visitor? How unusual.
I thought there was no one left who could face me. 
I was rather sad about it......

Marisa (Otter):
Found ya!
God of destruction that defies the law of beasts! 
Keiki Haniyasushin!
The time where your ambitions crumble has come!

Keiki:
That's good. 
Animals should be lively, after all.
You give off the fishy odor of 
one of the Kiketsu Family.

Marisa (Otter):
......!?

Keiki:
But you look like a human... 
What manner of cowardly trick are you pulling?

Marisa:
Hey, wait. I don't just look 
like a human, I am one.
I'm just using an animal spirit 
for a bit to get here.

Keiki:
...!?
I see... So you've 
possessed a living human.
You deceived and dragged in a 
foolish, ignorant human?
What exactly did you think would happen? 
Otter spirit, correct? ...Of the Kiketsu Family.

Marisa (Otter):
(...You're not afraid 
of a living human!?)
(Lady Kicchou! 
This isn't what you said would happen!)

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
Human, 
don't be fooled by this beast spirit.

Marisa:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idoladeus) who protects 
the human spirits from the beasts.
There's just no need for fellow humans 
to fight each other. Don't you agree?

Marisa:
Huh? 
Are you a human?

Marisa (Otter):
(Don't be fooled, magician.)
(She's nothing more than a wicked god 
who drains faith from the human spirits!)
(She's an enemy of beasts, and of humans!)

Marisa:
What? 
I can't tell what's going on.
Which one of you is lying?

Keiki:
Worrying about which one to believe, 
the beasts or me, is absurd.
I am the god who saved the 
oppressed human spirits.
And the animal spirit possessing you 
right now is an enemy of humankind!
What do you think... 
Will you become my ally......?

Marisa (Otter):
(Oh, oh no! 
We've been chatting for too long, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! 
Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Marisa (Otter):
Make a temporary retreat! 
Run!

Keiki:
It seems you have some kind of plan, but 
to desert before the enemy......!
I'm disappointed. 
But beasts are beasts, after all.
That's right, I will destroy your human flesh, and 
rebuild you more beautifully, with clay and water!
Human from the faraway surface! 
I will make you into the Animal Realm's finest idol!

Marisa (Otter):
Human, you've fought well! 
Help is on the way!
You've proven yourself a true warrior! 
Land the final blow on this wicked god of isolation!

Marisa:
Lotta beast spirits here, huh?
Looks like they're coming from across the river, 
no doubt about it.

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Marisa:
Oh, those stacked stones? 
I thought they were just a mess someone left.
I cleaned the place out for ya. 
You should thank me!

Eika:
What's with that attitude?! 
I won't forgive you!

Eika:
Get out of here! Now!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...
Stone stacks are a sacred, noble thing... 
Remember that one fact.

Marisa:
Really? 
Welp, must be nice.
If you can be happy just stackin' 
a bunch of stones, I'm kinda jealous.

Eika:
Wah... 
The tears won't stop...

Marisa:
This river's as creepy as always...

???:
I never thought I'd see a flesh and blood human 
in the Sanzu River (a place like this) .

Urumi:
Are you lost? 
This isn't a place for the living.

Marisa:
'Ey, finally someone I can talk to! 
Perfect timing.
Tell me which way Higan is, now! 
If you can't, then get lost!

Urumi:
Hm? 
You wanna go to Higan, of all places?
Well, from where you're standing...

Urumi:
It's straight to the northeast-- the "demon's gate". 
Come closer to me, now.

Urumi:
Mrgh. You're strong.

Marisa:
What a pointless battle. 
Now, which way is Higan?

Urumi:
Just keep going straight ahead.

Marisa:
Sheesh, you coulda just said 
so in the first place.
I'm tryin' to conserve my magic for Hell, ya know.

Urumi:
You're not just heading 
for Higan, but for Hell?
You, uh... 
You've got my condolences.

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Marisa:
And who're you?

Kutaka:
I am Kutaka. I watch over 
the border checkpoint of Hell.
I've been testing you, 
to see if you're capable of withstanding Hell.

Marisa:
You've been testing me, huh?
Pretty cocky, for a chicken.

Kutaka:
Chickens may be niwatori, but I am the god of Niwatari.
I would say that I'm far more distinguished than 
some eagle who's merely possessing a human.

Marisa:
Excuse me?
Do you have any idea who I am?

Marisa:
It's way too late for you to apologize! 
I'm having fried chicken tonight!

Kutaka:
I-I give in!
I bear no hostile intent towards you, truly.

Marisa:
If you understand, then alright.

Kutaka:
I just wanted to confirm that you wouldn't 
find yourself in danger in Hell.

Marisa:
I don't need any of your little tests.
Now, are you gonna open 
the gate to Hell or not?

Kutaka:
Oh right, that reminds me. 
I have one more important warning for you.
According to the Yama, it'd be unwise to 
trust that beast spirit possessing you.
And with that, please enjoy your time in Hell.

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

Yachie:
You've done well to follow me.

Marisa:
Huff, huff...
Hell's winds sure take a toll on ya.
But I finally caught up to you!
You're the beast spirit who's trying to take over the surface!

Yachie:
Oh, you came here to subjugate the beast spirits?
Alas, I'm afraid that the beast spirit you are looking for is not me.

Yachie:
The beast spirit you see as your enemy, is not in Hell (here) .

Marisa:
Huh?
Are you trying to trick me? 
What a thoughtless beast spirit.

Yachie:
It's fine even if 
you think I'm lying.
Choose not to believe me, 
and you shall never
find your enemy 
in this hopelessly large Hell.

Marisa:
W-Well. I'll look into whether 
you're lying after I defeat you!

Yachie:
You should've done this from the start. 
If you win against me then I'll tell you where your true enemy is.

Yachie:
W-wonderful! 
With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, I shall guide you to the 
enemy you must defeat.

Marisa:
Who exactly are you?

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family. 
Do you really need any further explanation?

Marisa:
Leader! ......of the Kiketsu Family?
I wonder why... Even though I'm positive I've never heard of her, 
I still feel like I know about her...

Yachie:
You're just the human who came 
to stop the beast spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. 
Nothing more...

Marisa:
Role... When you phrase it like that 
it feels like I had an important mission.
Nothin' to do about it, tell me wheret the enemy base's is.

Yachie:
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm, 
located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure 
located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Marisa:
So the enemy's in the center of the Animal Realm, huh?
I wasted effort fighting you then. 
Bye.

Yachie:
Warrior of Gouyoku, chosen by the eagles! 
I trust that you're not just talk!
Go forth! 
Destroy the demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Marisa:
What even is this place?
Seems totally different 
from Hell back there.
Is that the "structure in the 
center of the Animal Realm" 
that the person back there mentioned......?

???:
A human?
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste, 
or you'll be captured by the starving beasts.

Marisa:
What's the Primate Spirit Garden?
Do you mean that burial mound thing over there? 
It's certainly a garden for spirits.

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! 
You're a flesh-and-blood human!
How did you manage to survive in 
such a dog-eat-dog place?

Marisa:
I'm not a resident of this place.
I came here from the surface to 
exterminate the beast spirits, and......
......
(Ugh, I can't move!?
......it's the eagle spirit's doing!)

Marisa (Eagle):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here 
just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... 
Could you be an eagle spirit?
To think that an eagle would be so humble 
as to rely on a living human...

Marisa (Eagle):
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance 
with that loathsome Kiketsu Family!
I shall liberate the human spirits (slaves) 
from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! 
It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-so strong! So this is what 
living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Marisa (Eagle):
(Yes! 
I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks! 
human magician!)

Marisa:
......
To think that the eagle spirit 
would take over my body.

Marisa (Eagle):
(It's me. The eagle spirit.)
(With the two of us combined, 
we can take back the Animal Realm!)
(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of 
the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(That should sound pretty good to you too, no?)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had 
since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Marisa:
This has gotten serious.
Well. that's fine. 
The person back there did irritate me.
I'm looking forwards to meeting the boss now!

Mayumi:
To think that living humans 
were such strong creatures!
This reality is just like a dream!

Marisa:
So this is the inside of the burial mound......
This place is just weird on top of weird.
Eagle spirit, where's our enemy?

Marisa (Eagle):
(...)
(This is the interior of the Garden...?)
(It's filled with man-made material now...!
What happened to the beautiful nature?!)

Keiki:
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact 
that nobody was left to fight against us...

Marisa (Eagle):
So you've showed up.
The god of destruction who broke the laws of animal-kind! 
Keiki Haniyasushin!
Your reign ends here!

Keiki:
God of destruction? 
Talk about rude.
In this eat-or-be-eaten Animal Realm, 
there's nobody else who's created as much as I have.

Marisa:
Who are you? 
Are you my enemy?

Keiki:
Huh?
You were acting like you knew me a second ago...
...Wait, are you
a human?!

Marisa:
Yep, I'm a human alright.
I hear that you're apparently my enemy.

Marisa (Eagle):
Silence!
This is my chance to defeat the 
wicked god standing before us.
For just this moment, I, the mighty eagle,
shall be Marisa Kirisame!

Keiki:
I see... you possessed a human 
and brought them all the way here.
But what exactly do you 
hope to accomplish...
By tricking and dragging along some foolish human who 
doesn't know anything? Care to answer, eagle spirit?

Marisa (Eagle):
......

Keiki:
You're from the Gouyoku Alliance, right?
Famous for being ridiculously prideful, but 
lacking in capabilities in every other area...

Marisa (Eagle):
Hmph. But if I defeat you, 
I can steal the Animal Realm's top seat!
I heard that you're weak against living humans, too! 
Now, have at thee!

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
You there, human. 
Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

Marisa:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola Deus) who protects the 
human spirits from those foul beasts.
There's no need for fellow humans to fight each other. 
Don't you agree?

Marisa:
Huh? 
Are you human?

Marisa (Eagle):
Don't be fooled, magician.
She's no ally of humans at all.
She's a wicked god who drove the human spirits 
who summoned her to their destruction!

Marisa:
Wh-what? 
I don't really get it.
Who's spitting lies here?

Keiki:
To trust in me or the beast spirit? 
I wonder why you hesitate?
I am a god that saved 
the humans who were being persecuted!
The beast spirit possessing you right now, 
is the enemy of mankind!
Well? 
Won't you join my side...?

Marisa (Eagle):
(T-This is bad! 
We let her stall for too long, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! 
Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Marisa (Eagle):
We must retreat for now! 
RUN!

Keiki:
Even though you seemed like you had a plan... 
To escape right before your foe...
I'm disappointed! 
Beasts will be beasts after all.
That's it, I'll destroy this human's body of flesh, 
and build it anew from soil and water!
Humans from the surface are rare! 
I'll make you the best idol in the Animal Realm!

Marisa (Eagle):
You've done well to survive this long, human! 
Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now!
Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Youmu:
It's just like I heard.
There are countless beast spirits 
crossing the Sanzu River...!

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Youmu:
The stones? Yeah, I knocked them all down. 
Do I get a prize?

Eika:
H-How awful! Every pile here was a priceless 
masterpiece made by the children!

Eika:
I'll avenge them!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Youmu:
Oh, whoops. I forgot about the pile 
that you're sitting on top of.
Once I knock it over, I'll have a perfect score!

Eika:
You're worse than an oni...
Go fall into Hell, why don't you!

Youmu:
Ignoring the shinigami's ferry 
might've been a mistake on my part...

???:
I thought you were a lost phantom...

Urumi:
But it looks like you're still alive, huh?

Youmu:
Are you... that ushi-oni?
I heard that ever since you got banned from attacking humans...
You started a fish farming 
business at the Sanzu River.

Urumi:
Yep. The river's a peaceful place.

Urumi:
But now that you've come along, it's a different story! 
Nobody would blame me for attackin' a human like you!

Urumi:
Grgh... Now I remember.
You're that happy-go-lucky 
gardener from the Netherworld...

Youmu:
Right now, though, I happen to be feeling a little testy.
Well, this was a pretty good warm-up 
before heading for Hell.

Urumi:
Oh, so you're going to Hell...?
Would you mind telling me what's 
goin' on down there, by any chance?

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Youmu:
Ah, you're Niwatari-sama.
I'm a servant of the Netherworld.
I need access to Hell, 
so please open the gate.

Kutaka:
So you're already familiar with me. 
Let's get straight to the point, then.
I shall hereby test whether you are 
capable of surviving Hell.

Youmu:
Very well. 
My sword shall taste your blood!

Kutaka:
Mere talk won't get you 
anywhere in Hell!

Kutaka:
W-Well done.
I suppose you'll do fine in Hell. 
You won't be killed instantly, at least.

Youmu:
Of course I'll be fine. I'll slice them to 
pieces before they even get the chance!

Kutaka:
How very confident.
Remember this one warning, however:
The spirits of Hell will try to crawl into 
your heart wherever there's an opening.
If you overestimate your power, there's sure to be 
a spirit that'll take advantage of that weakness.
As a servant of the Netherworld, I'm sure 
you know this already, but just in case...

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

???:
You've done well to follow me.

Youmu:
Huff, huff...
Real karmic winds really feel suffocating huh.
That's Hell for you.
By the way, who are you?
You don't seem to be one of Hell's oni.

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family, Yachie Kicchou.
Right back at you, identify yourself.

Youmu:
Pardon my manners. I am Youmu Konpaku.
I came from Hakugyokurou in the Netherworld in order to investigate the animal spirits invading the surface.
The Kiketsu Family...... I apologize but I don't seem to have heard of it.

Yachie:
No, that can't be right. You should know of us.

Youmu:
Hmm, oh? Now that you mention it I think I have......

Yachie:
In addition, you should also know that the animal spirit you are looking for is not in Hell (here) .

Youmu:
Yeah, maybe?

Yachie:
Allow me to tell you where your true enemy is! Follow me!

Yachie:
What wonderful skill. With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, allow me to guide you to the enemy.

Youmu:
T-Thank you...
I wonder why... This should be our first meeting, and yet I feel like that's not the case.

Yachie:
I'm positive that that's the case.
However, you are just the human who came to stop the animal spirits' invasion.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. Nothing more...

Youmu:
My... role... Yes, that is to defeat the enemy!

Yachie:
The animal spirits are in the Animal Realm, located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Youmu:
The enemy's in the Animal Realm...... It's my first time going there,
but I'm kinda excited! I'll cut apart everything that stands in my way!

Yachie:
Truly reassuring! Oh warrior of Keiga, chosen by the wolves!
Go forth! Destroy the demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Youmu:
I've heard that the Animal Realm is a city,
but this is way more than what I had in mind.
I wonder if that keyhole-shaped thing in front of me is my destination.

???:
A human?
You'd better get back to the Primate Spirit Garden post-haste, or you'll be captured by the starving beasts.

Youmu:
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Is that the forest surrounded by the lake there?

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! What are you!?

Youmu:
I'm a resident of the Netherworld,
I came here to exterminate the animal spirits, and......
......
(Huh? My body isn't moving!? Is this the wolf spirit's doing!?)

Youmu (Wolf):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... Could you be a wolf spirit?
To think that a wolf would be smart enough to rely on a living human...

Youmu (Wolf):
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance with that loathsome Kiketsu Family!
I shall liberate the human spirits (our prey) from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! It is the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-so strong! So this is what living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Youmu (Wolf):
(Yes! I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks, swordsman of the Netherworld!)

Youmu:
......
How careless of me. To think that I would be taken over by the wolf spirit......

Youmu (Wolf):
(Sorry about that. It's me, the wolf spirit.)
(But thanks to you, we can gain entry to the Primate Spirit Garden.)
(Just a little further...!)
(Just a little further, and we animal spirits can take back control of the Animal Realm.)
(If we do that, the animal spirits' invasion of the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(Worry not. Our objectives are the same.)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Youmu:
Got it.
All we have to do is defeat the boss of the person back there, yeah?
Let's go before my blade rusts. To the Primate Garden or whatever!

Mayumi:
To think that living humans were such strong creatures!
This reality is just like a dream!

Youmu:
It's a world I've never seen before.
You wouldn't think it'd look like this from the outside.
So our enemy's somewhere in here, right wolf spirit?

Youmu (Wolf):
(......)
(W-what is all this?!)
(The Garden was so full of nature, but now... I'll never forgive those curs!)

???:
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact that nobody was left to fight against us...

Youmu (Wolf):
I've finally found you!
The god of destruction who broke the laws of animal-kind! Keiki Haniyasushin!
I brought a live human along to destroy your idols!

Keiki:
A live human?!
That's ridiculous... Who would believe that?

Youmu:
Excuse me, but I'm the living human......
Well, half of me's a ghost though.

Keiki:
From the Netherworld, you mean? My, thank you so much for coming all the way.
So do you have some sort of trick up your sleeve? Care to answer, wolf spirit?

Youmu (Wolf):
......

Keiki:
You're a wolf from the Keiga Family, right? Useless for anything except biting?

Youmu (Wolf):
...How'd you know?

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
Resident of the Netherworld, do not be fooled.

Youmu:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola Deus) who protects the human spirits from those foul beasts.
The animal spirits tricked you here in order to take away the Primate Spirit Garden!

Youmu:
Huh? What?

Youmu (Wolf):
Don't be fooled, swordsman.
She's a wicked god who destroyed the divine blessing of Nature!
She's an enemy of beasts and humans both!

Youmu:
Y-Yeah, I thought so.
I'd be crazy if I start doubting the animal spirit after having come this far.

Keiki:
Do you truly think the wolf is telling the truth?

Youmu:
W-Well, I dunno...
Wolf spirit! Tell me the truth, I won't be fooled any longer!

Youmu (Wolf):
You wishy-washy fool! She's the enemy!

Keiki:
Truly, I hate indecisiveness. You'll regret this for life...

Youmu (Wolf):
(O-Oh no! We let her stall for too long, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Youmu (Wolf):
We must retreat for now! RUN!

Keiki:
...You brought a human all the way from the Netherworld to escape right before your foe!
I'm disappointed, you know. I guess beasts will be beasts after all.
I'll destroy your flesh, and build it anew from soil and water!
Half ghost and half haniwa, you'll be an idol that truly stands apart!

Youmu (Wolf):
You've done well to survive this long, human! Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now! Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Youmu:
It's just like I heard.
There are countless beast spirits 
crossing the Sanzu River...!

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Youmu:
Stones...? 
Oh, right. This is the Sai no Kawara...
Sorry, but I'm kind of 
in a hurry...

Eika:
We were supposed to have our 
stone-stacking contest today!

Eika:
There's no fixing this now! 
You'll pay with your blood!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Youmu:
I really don't have time to be 
messing around here...
Well, I'll be going now. Bye.

Eika:
She knocked over all the children's artwork, too...
...Guess I'll just have to say a storm passed by.
Well, these things happen. 
We'll just have a speed-stacking contest today instead.

Youmu:
Ignoring the shinigami's ferry 
might've been a mistake on my part...

???:
I thought you were a lost phantom...

Urumi:
But it looks like you're still alive, huh?

Youmu:
Are you... that ushi-oni?
Perfect timing. 
I'm a servant of the Netherworld.
But I've gotten kind of lost... 
Can you remind me which way Higan is?

Urumi:
Ah, right. You're the Netherworld's happy-go-lucky gardener...
...not. You're an imposter, ain'tcha?

Urumi:
A servant of the Netherworld would 
never get lost in the Sanzu River!

Urumi:
Grgh... for a lousy impostor, 
you sure are strong.

Youmu:
No, uh, I'm real. 
I really did just get lost...
I usually have the shinigami 
lead the way, but...
I'm in a hurry today, 
so I kinda jumped the gun.

Urumi:
Oh. Right. Now I remember.
The Netherworld's gardener has a carefree 
attitude... and a totally empty head.

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Youmu:
Ah, you're Niwatari-sama.
I'm a servant of the Netherworld.
And, see, I kind of 
have to go to Hell...

Kutaka:
So you're already familiar with me. 
Let's get straight to the point, then.
I shall hereby test whether you are 
capable of surviving Hell.

Youmu:
Oh. Yeah, I... guess we have to fight, huh.

Kutaka:
You'll never be able to survive Hell 
with a timid attitude like that.

Kutaka:
If your sights are set on Hell, 
then give me everything you've got!

Kutaka:
W-Well done.
I suppose you'll do fine in Hell. 
You won't be killed instantly, at least.

Youmu:
That's good. 
...I guess Hell is up next, though...
Honestly, I'd rather not 
have to go there at all.

Kutaka:
Your will is quite weak... 
But that may prove dangerous.
The spirits of Hell will try to crawl into 
your heart wherever there's an opening.
If you're anxious, there's sure to be a spirit 
that'll take advantage of that weakness.
Although it seems that one such spirit 
is already present inside you...

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

???:
You've done well to follow me.

Youmu:
Huff, huff...
Real karmic winds really feel suffocating huh. That's Hell for you.
By the way, who are you?
You don't seem to be one of Hell's oni.

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family, Yachie Kicchou.

Youmu (Otter):
The Kiketsu Family...... 
Ah, the one that formed the elite unit!

Youmu:
(Huh? I've never heard of the Kiketsu Family, 
so what am I saying?)

Yachie:
Stop. 
Run your mouth any more and we will be exposed.
So first, give me your name.

Youmu:
Pardon my manners. 
I am Youmu Konpaku.
I came from Hakugyokurou in the Netherworld 
in order to investigate the animal spirits invading the surface.

Yachie:
The beast spirit you see as your enemy,
is not in Hell (here) .

Youmu:
Huh?
Is... that the case?

Yachie:
Allow me to tell you where your true enemy is! 
Follow me!

Yachie:
What wonderful skill. 
With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, allow me to guide 
you to the enemy.

Youmu (Otter):
Thank you so much, ma'am. 
I've been looking for that helpful lecture so long.

Youmu:
(Huh!?)
(I wonder why I'm being so humble 
to a person I haven't met before?)

Yachie:
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. Nothing more...
The beast spirits are in the Animal Realm, 
located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure 
located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Youmu:
U-Understood.
By all means, I'll be sure to defeat them.

Yachie:
Oh sneak attacker, chosen by the otters! 
Remember the iron-clad law of the Kiketsu Family!
There is no route swifter or more effective than the rear! 
Destroy the demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Youmu:
I've heard that the 
Animal Realm is a city,
but this is way more than what I had in mind.
I wonder if that keyhole-shaped thing 
in front of me is my destination.

???:
A human?
If you don't hurry back to the Primate Spirit Garden, 
you'll be captured by the starving beasts.

Youmu:
The Primate Garden?
Is that the forest surrounded by the lake there?

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! 
Who are you?

Youmu:
I'm a resident of the Netherworld,
I came here from the surface to exterminate 
the animal spirits, and......
......
(Huh? My body isn't moving!? 
......Is this the otter spirit's doing!?)

Youmu (Otter):
Heh heh heh!
I brought a live human down here
just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
This aura I'm sensing from you...... 
Could you be an otter spirit?

Youmu (Otter):
That's right! Now, face the elite 
underhanded tactics of the Kiketsu-gumi!

Mayumi:
Right, the Kiketsu-gumi do Kicchou's bidding.

Youmu (Otter):
We shall liberate the human spirits (tools) 
from you accursed idols!
Brace yourself! 
In the Animal Realm, it's survival of the fittest!

Mayumi:
S-So strong! Your level is much above 
human spirits in the Animal Realm..!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Youmu (Otter):
(Yes! 
I'll be sure to win at this rate!)
(You have my thanks, 
swordsman of the Netherworld!)

Youmu:
...
How careless of me. To think that I would be 
taken over by the otter spirit......

Youmu (Otter):
(It's me, the otter spirit. 
Once again, thank you.)
(Thanks to you, we'll be able 
to destroy those idols.)
(I'd like it if you could 
cooperate just a little longer.)
(Once we defeat the idols, the animal spirits 
will once more rule the Animal Realm.)
(And if that happens, then the animal spirits 
will call off their invasion of the surface.)
(Your goal and mine are one and the same. 
Let's join forces and win!)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had 
since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Youmu:
Got it.
I also think the lady back there was the bad guy, 
although I'm not sure why I think so.
Now, let's go cut up this evil! 
To the Primate Garden or whatever!

Mayumi:
To think that humans of flesh and blood 
were such strong creatures!
What a dream-like reality!

Youmu:
It's a world I've never seen before.
You wouldn't think it'd look like this from the outside.
So our enemy's somewhere in here,
right otter spirit?

Youmu (Otter):
(...)
(The Primate Garden was said to be the 
most beautiful park in the Animal Realm...)
(I had heard rumors, but its 
current state is deplorable.)

???:
A visitor? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact 
that nobody was left to fight against us...

Youmu (Otter):
Found ya!
God of destruction that defies the law of beasts! 
Keiki Haniyasushin!
The time where your ambitions crumble has come!

Keiki:
That's good.
Animals should be lively, after all.
You give off the fishy odor of
one of the Kiketsu Family.

Youmu (Otter):
......!?

Keiki:
But you look like a human... 
What manner of cowardly trick are you pulling?

Youmu:
I might look like a human, 
but half of me's a phantom.

Keiki:
I see. You possessed a human, 
and tricked them into coming here.

Youmu:
Umm, I'm a resident of the Netherworld, 
so half of me's a phantom to begin with.

Keiki:
Otter spirit, correct? ...Of the Kiketsu Family. 
You say you brought a human here, what about it?

Youmu (Otter):
(...She's not afraid 
of a living human!?)
(Lady Kicchou! 
This isn't what you said would happen!)

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
Resident of the Netherworld, 
don't be fooled by this animal spirit.

Youmu:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola deus) who protects 
the human spirits from the beasts.
The animal spirits are lying to you, 
so that they could take away the Primate Spirit Garden.

Youmu:
Huh? 
What?

Youmu (Otter):
(Don't be fooled, swordsman of the Netherworld.)
(She's nothing more than a wicked god 
who drains faith from the human spirits!)
(She's an enemy of beasts and humans both!)

Youmu:
Y-Yeah, I thought so.
It'd be weird if I came all the way here 
without believing in the animal spirits.

Keiki:
Do you truly think the 
otter is telling the truth?

Youmu:
W-Well, I dunno... 
Otter spirit! Tell me the truth, I won't be fooled any longer!

Youmu (Otter):
What a wishy-washy fellow......

Keiki:
Truly, I hate indecisiveness. 
You'll regret this for life...

Youmu (Otter):
(Oh, oh no! We let her stall for too long, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! 
Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Youmu (Otter):
Make a temporary retreat! 
RUN!

Keiki:
...You brought a human all the way from the Netherworld 
to escape right before your foe!
I'm disappointed, you know. 
I guess beasts will be beasts after all.
I'll destroy your flesh, 
and build it anew from soil and water!
Half-phantom half-haniwa, 
you'll be an idol that truly stands apart!

Youmu (Otter):
Human, you've fought well! 
Help is on the way!
We are the strong ones now! 
Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Youmu:
It's just like I heard.
There are countless beast spirits 
crossing the Sanzu River...!

???:
Hey, you there!

Eika:
All the stones we were stacking fell over 
because you were thrashing around!

Youmu:
The spirit of a stillborn...
There's no point to stacking stones in 
some dreary place like this, you know.
Shall I put in a good word for you, 
so you can go to the Netherworld?

Eika:
Shouldn't you apologize first?
And for your information, we stillborns 
like this dry riverbed!

Eika:
This riverbed is our own little kingdom!

Eika:
Gugugu... So strong...

Youmu:
I see, I see. 
A kingdom of stillborns...
No matter how many weaklings you gather 
together, though, you'll all still be weak.

Eika:
Strength doesn't matter to us.
We're here because we enjoy the 
simple work of stacking stones!

Youmu:
Ignoring the shinigami's ferry 
might've been a mistake on my part...

???:
I thought you were a lost phantom...

Urumi:
But it looks like you're still alive, huh?

Youmu:
Are you... that ushi-oni?
I heard that ever since you got banned from attacking humans...
You started a fish farming business at the Sanzu River.
Drinking river water instead of blood now, 
are you? How does it taste?

Urumi:
Are you tryin' to pick a fight 
with me or somethin'?
If you wanna fight me, knowing full 
well that I'm an ushi-oni...

Urumi:
Then I won't hesitate to drown 
you in the river either!

Urumi:
Grgh... Now I remember.
You're that happy-go-lucky 
gardener from the Netherworld...

Youmu:
Exactly. You only just remembered? 
Cows are pretty dumb.

Urumi:
No, uh, I was just wonderin' if your 
personality was always this nasty...

Youmu:
By the way, I have a favor to ask...

Urumi:
What's that?

Youmu:
Which direction was Higan?
I-I'm not lost, of course. 
I'm just making sure! Really!

Urumi:
Pfft, you're the same carefree gardener as ever. 
Musta been my imagination...

???:
I've heard about you from the Yama.
She told me to test you with no mercy!

???:
Just as I'd expect from someone 
trying to get to Hell.
You're quite skilled indeed.

Youmu:
Ah, you're Niwatari-sama.
I am a servant of the Netherworld.
You'll open the gate for me right now, yes?

Kutaka:
So you're already familiar with me.
I shall hereby test whether you are 
capable of surviving Hell.
If you wish to enter, you'll 
have to defeat me first.

Youmu:
Very well. 
Come at me with all thy might!

Youmu:
Test my ability to survive 
the fires of Hell!

Youmu:
That ought to be enough.

Kutaka:
Er, um, well, I suppose so...

Youmu:
Feel free to open the gate 
to Hell any time now.

Kutaka:
Umm. I'm not exactly sure who 
was testing who just now...
Remember this one warning, however:
The spirits of Hell will try to crawl into 
your heart wherever there's an opening.
If you're conceited, there's sure to be a spirit 
that'll take advantage of that weakness.
As a servant of the Netherworld, I'm sure 
you know this already, but just in case...

???:
Ah, a human of flesh and blood.
Hell is hopelessly large, you know?
Allow me to guide you.

???:
You've done well to follow me.

Youmu:
Huff, huff...
Real karmic winds really feel suffocating huh. That's Hell for you.
By the way, who are you?
You don't seem to be one of Hell's oni.

Yachie:
I am the leader of the Kiketsu Family, 
Yachie Kicchou.
Right back at you, identify yourself.

Youmu:
Oh? Pardon my manners. 
I am Youmu Konpaku.
I came here to subjugate 
the animal spirits invading the surface.
You're suspicious no matter how I look at it. 
Come clean now if you have anything planned!

Yachie:
I'm not the enemy you're searching for.
And your enemy's not in Hell (here) either, 
what a shame.

Youmu:
You really think I'll believe what you're saying?
I'll have you tell me the details once I defeat you!

Yachie:
What wonderful skill. 
With a human like you, everything should go just fine.
Now then, allow me to guide 
you to the enemy.

Youmu:
Oh? Are you really not the enemy?
Now that you mention it, 
I don't really feel like you're the dangerous type.

Yachie:
So you finally understand.
I'm going to tell you where the enemy is.
Your role is simply to defeat said enemy. 
Nothing more...

Youmu:
Tell me where they are then, 
I wanna defeat them quickly.

Yachie:
The animal spirits are in the Animal Realm, 
located next door to Hell.
There's a particularly prominent structure 
located in the center of the Animal Realm...
That's the enemy's main base.

Youmu:
Center of the Animal Realm!
I thank you for telling me. 
Alright, let's go and destroy those wicked beasts!

Yachie:
Warrior of Gouyoku, chosen by the eagles! 
I trust that you're not just talk!
Go forth! 
Destroy the demon-shaped enemy, cursed in extremity!

Youmu:
I've heard that the 
Animal Realm is a city,
but this is way more than what I had in mind.
I wonder if that keyhole-shaped thing 
in front of me is my destination.

???:
A human?
If you don't hurry back to the Primate Spirit Garden, 
you'll be captured by the starving beasts.

Youmu:
The Primate Spirit Garden?
Is that the forest surrounded by the lake there?

???:
You don't know about the Primate Spirit Garden?

Mayumi:
Actually, speaking of which...
You're not a human spirit from the Animal Realm! 
Who are you?

Youmu:
I'm a resident of the Netherworld,
I came here from the surface to exterminate
the animal spirits, and......
......
(Huh? My body isn't moving!? 
......Is this the eagle spirit's doing!?)

Youmu (Eagle):
Heh heh heh.
I brought a live human down here 
just to destroy the lot of you!

Mayumi:
That aura I feel from you... 
Could you be an eagle spirit?
To think that an eagle would be so humble 
as to rely on a living human...

Youmu (Eagle):
For this sole reason, we formed an alliance 
with that loathsome Kiketsu Family!
I shall liberate the human spirits (slaves) 
from you accursed idols!
Prepare yourself! 
It's the law of the Animal Realm that the strong eat the weak!

Mayumi:
S-so strong! So this is what 
living humans are like...!
What a fearsome strategy...!

Youmu (Eagle):
(Yes! 
At this rate, we'll win!)
(Thank you, 
swordswoman of Netherworld!)

Youmu:
...
How careless of me. To think that I would be 
taken over by the eagle spirit......

Youmu (Eagle):
(It's me. The eagle spirit.)
(With the two of us combined, 
we can take back the Animal Realm!)
(If we do that, the beast spirits' invasion of 
the surface will be sure to cease as well.)
(That should sound pretty good to you too, no?)

Mayumi:
This is the first emergency situation we've had 
since the Haniwa Soldiers were created!
I have to go alert everyone quick!

Youmu:
Got it.
So there's an enemy you can't 
defeat without bringing me here?
Well, I came all the way here, let's cut them all up!

Mayumi:
To think that living humans 
were such strong creatures!
What a dream-like reality!

Youmu:
It's a world I've never seen before.
You wouldn't think it'd look like this from the outside.
So our enemy's somewhere in here, 
right, eagle spirit?

Youmu (Eagle):
(...)
(This is the interior of the Garden...?)
(It's filled with man-made material now...!
What happened to the beautiful nature?!)

???:
A guest? How rare.
And here, I had almost shed a tear at the fact 
that nobody was left to fight against us...

Youmu (Eagle):
So you've showed up.
The god of destruction who broke the laws of animal-kind! 
Keiki Haniyasushin!
Your reign ends here!

Keiki:
God of destruction? 
Talk about rude.
In this eat-or-be-eaten Animal Realm, 
there's nobody else who's created as much as I have.

Youmu:
Uh, well, 
can I ask your name?

Keiki:
Huh? 
You were acting like you knew me a second ago...

Youmu:
Well... it was the eagle spirit who was 
possessing me who spoke to you just now.
I am Youmu Konpaku. 
I came from the Netherworld to investigate the animal spirits.

Youmu (Eagle):
Silence!
This is my chance to defeat the 
wicked god standing before us.
For just this moment, I, the mighty eagle, 
shall be Youmu Konpaku!

Youmu:
(Wha‚Å†‚Äî b-but...)

Keiki:
I see... you possessed a human 
and brought them all the way here.
But what exactly do you 
hope to accomplish...
By tricking and dragging along some foolish human who 
doesn't know anything? Care to answer, eagle spirit?

Youmu (Eagle):
......

Keiki:
You're from the Gouyoku Alliance, right?
Famous for being ridiculously prideful, but 
lacking in capabilities in every other area...

Youmu (Eagle):
Hmph. But if I defeat you, 
I can steal the Animal Realm's top seat!
I heard that you're weak against living humans, too! 
Now, have at thee!

Keiki:
Heh heh heh.
You there, the resident of the Netherworld. 
Don't let this beast spirit deceive you.

Youmu:
Huh?

Keiki:
I am the sculptor god (Idola Deus) who protects the 
human spirits from those foul beasts.
The animal spirits tricked you here in order to 
take away the Primate Spirit Garden!

Youmu:
Huh? 
What are you saying?

Youmu (Eagle):
Don't be fooled, swordsman of the Netherworld.
She's no ally of humans at all.
She's a wicked god who drove the human spirits 
who summoned her to their destruction!

Youmu:
Y-Yeah, I thought so.
I'd be crazy if I start doubting 
the animal spirit after having come this far.

Keiki:
My my, I wonder if the eagle's words 
can really be trusted?

Youmu:
W-Well, I dunno... 
Eagle spirit! Tell me the truth, I won't be fooled any longer!

Youmu (Eagle):
Don't mess with me! 
How dare you say I'm lying?

Youmu:
I feel like I came here 'cause 
you lied to me about all kinds of stuff though......

Keiki:
Hehehe, being indecisive is a disadvantage. 
You'll regret this for life...

Youmu (Eagle):
(T-This is bad! 
We let her stall for too long, human!)
(She's about to unleash her sculpting arts! 
Every last one of us beast spirits was defeated by them!)

Youmu (Eagle):
We must retreat for now! 
RUN!

Keiki:
...You brought a human all the way from the Netherworld 
to escape right before your foe!
I'm disappointed, you know. 
I guess beasts will be beasts after all.
I'll destroy your flesh, 
and build it anew from soil and water!
Half-phantom half-haniwa, 
you'll be an idol that truly stands apart!

Youmu (Eagle):
You've done well to survive this long, human! 
Our reinforcements will arrive in seconds!
We are the strong ones now! 
Land the finishing blow on this lonesome, wicked god!

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Reimu:
So true invaders from 
the Animal Realm showed up! 
Since I gave them the opportunity by returning to the surface, 
guess I'll have to take them down too!

Reimu (Wolf):
(......) 
(Hehehe...)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! I see pretending to be used by Kicchou paid off, 
Wolf spirit!

Reimu (Wolf):
......Yes! 
You overpraise me, Master Kurokoma.

Reimu:
Huh!? 
Who on earth are you?

Saki:
......This human doesn't know of me, huh.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Reimu:
The Keiga Family......?

Reimu (Wolf):
(This person here's my boss.) 
(The Keiga Family is an organization of animal spirits 
who pride themselves on their strong arms, swift legs and infinite courage.) 
(They're the strongest group in the Animal Realm, y'know.)

Reimu:
She's your boss? 
But then......

Saki:
So our brief deal with Kicchou in order to 
defeat Keiki has ended as well. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's‚Äî 
the Keiga Family's‚Äîworld. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Reimu:
I wonder if it would really go that smoothly? 
Roping me into the Animal Realm's conflict 
was a mistake! 
I'll beat you right here, 
and smack you straight back into the Animal Realm!

Saki:
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice. 
Unlike that foul Kicchou, 
I happen to like fighting!

Reimu (Wolf):
......

Saki:
Do you hear me? Wolf spirit, 
you will do all you can to help this human and come at me!
It won't be fun if she's 
not as strong as when she defeated Keiki.
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Reimu:
That so...... 
I'm completely worn out.

Saki:
I wonder, 
would you consider joining the Keiga Family?

Reimu:
Hm?

Saki:
I'm busy with ruling the Animal Realm, 
you see. 
So I'll leave the Human Realm to you, 
as the Human Realm division of the Keiga Family.

Reimu:
What? That's ridiculous...... 
It's not gonna happen, you know?

Saki:
Eh? How cruel of you to refuse...... 
To not rule over the Human Realm even though you're so strong. 
Why did you show me your powers then?

Reimu:
Wait, is everyone in the 
Keiga Family an idiot?

Reimu (Wolf):
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. 
It is as you've seen, we are physically strong, 
but our intellect is a bit...

Saki:
Whatever, then. 
Guess I'll have to cut open a path myself.
I'll be counting on you for when I visit the Human Realm next time, okay?

Reimu:
Huh? What for?

Saki:
A duel, of course. 
I want to see your power without the wolf spirit next time. 
If I win, I'll have you consider my proposition back there.

Reimu:
Ugh, I've had enough of this......

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit.
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface.
Please turn back now!

Reimu:
So true invaders from 
the Animal Realm showed up!
Since I gave them the opportunity by returning to the surface, 
guess I'll have to take them down too!

Reimu (Otter):
(......I wondered who it was, 
seems my suspicion was right.)
(This aura of great might points 
to that person!)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely!
Excellent work! Human! 
Show your face at once!

Reimu (Otter):
It's really you, Master Kurokoma! 
Why are you doing this!?

Reimu:
Huh!? 
Who on earth are you?

Saki:
......I see. 
So the animal spirit did not tell you about me.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Reimu:
The Keiga Family......?

Reimu (Otter):
This person here is the boss of our enemy.
The Keiga Family is a beastly organization 
full of muscleheads whose only redeeming quality is their strength.

Reimu:
(......Musclehead organization?)

Saki:
The one possessing you 
is an otter spirit from Kicchou's gang right?
Our brief deal with Kicchou in order to 
defeat Keiki has ended as well.
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society.
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's, 
the Keiga Family's, world.
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession.
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm, and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Reimu (Otter):
Wh-What to do? 
Master Kurokoma's being so aggressive......
We have to go and report to Master Kicchou now!

Reimu:
It'll be fine, otter spirit. 
The report can wait.
Roping me into the Animal Realm's conflict, 
was a mistake!
Since I'll beat you right here, 
and put an end to the beast's ambitions!

Saki:
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice.
Unlike that foul Kicchou, 
I happen to like fighting!

Reimu (Otter):
Human...... No, Reimu Hakurei. 
You have my thanks.

Saki:
Otter spirit of the Kiketsu Family! 
I see you've found a good human!
But I'll have you know that I'm strong. 
Hold nothing back and come at me!
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant*
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great!
I... I was moved!

Reimu:
That so...... 
I'm completely worn out.

Saki:
How about it? Won't you consider 
abandoning the otter spirit and joining the Keiga Family?

Reimu:
Hm?

Saki:
There are only perverse fellows in the Kiketsu Family, y'know.
The Keiga Family are full of 
straightforward folks.
We're a pretty bright organization, see? 
Your boss would be a pitch-black pegasus (Black Horse) though, hahaha.

Reimu (Otter):
This seems to be a favorite punch line for Master Kurokoma.
By the way, all organizations in the Animal Realm 
are pitch black, just so you know.

Reimu:
I see...... You animal spirits have it rough too, huh.

Saki:
I'm quite satisfied, 
I got to see the strength of humans.
I've decided! 
I'll go to the Human Realm next time!

Reimu:
What are you coming over for? 
It'll be a bother.

Saki:
Well, y'see... 
The Animal Realm's just too small for me.
Well, I'll be thanking you in advance.

Reimu:
I only have bad feelings about this......

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Reimu:
So true invaders from 
the Animal Realm showed up! 
Since I gave them the opportunity by returning to the surface, 
guess I'll have to take them down too!

Reimu (Eagle):
(......I wondered who it was, 
so it really is her.) 
(This unconcealed aura 
can only be her!)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! Human! 
Show your face at once!

Reimu (Eagle):
(It's really Kurokoma! 
Her arrogance is infuriating!)

Reimu:
Huh!? 
Who on earth are you?

Saki:
......I see. 
So the animal spirit did not tell you about me.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Reimu:
The Keiga Family......?

Reimu (Eagle):
This person is the sworn enemy of the Gouyoku Alliance. 
She's the leader of a violent group 
Who have nothing to boast of, not even their lifestyle.

Reimu:
......A violent group?

Saki:
The one possessing you 
is an eagle spirit from Toutetsu's gang right? 
To think the prideful Gouyoku Alliance would 
cooperate with Kiketsu Family, how unexpected. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's, 
the Keiga Family's, world. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm, and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Reimu (Eagle):
Don't be ridiculous. 
That would never happen! 
No, it might be possible 
for the violent leader of the Keiga Family!

Reimu:
It'll be fine, eagle spirit. 
I wouldn't allow the invasion to happen. 
Roping me into the Animal Realm's conflict 
was a mistake! 
Since I'll beat you right here, 
and put an end to the beast's ambitions!

Saki:
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice. 
Unlike that foul Kicchou, 
I happen to like fighting!

Reimu (Eagle):
Human...... I'll lend you my power! 
Let's stop the violent leader's rampage together!

Saki:
Eagle spirit of the Gouyoku Alliance! 
I see you've found a good human! 
But I'll have you know that I'm strong. 
Hold nothing back and come at me! 
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Reimu:
That so...... 
I'm completely worn out.

Saki:
How about it? Won't you consider 
abandoning the eagle spirit and joining the Keiga Family?

Reimu:
Hm?

Saki:
A human may not know this, 
but the leader of the Gouyoku Alliance, Toutetsu, is the worst. 
If a greedy bastard is at the top of the organization, 
the underlings would never be happy. 
When it comes to that, the Keiga Family is (we're) better. 
You can climb up the ladder quickly as long as you're strong.

Reimu:
I have no intention of 
joining any of the animal spirit organizations, y'know?

Reimu (Eagle):
(Ehh? I thought you 
were already a part of us~.)

Saki:
Well, whatever.
I'm quite satisfied, 
I got to see the strength of human today. 
I've decided! 
I'll go to the Human Realm next time!

Reimu:
What are you coming over for? 
It'll be a bother.

Saki:
Well, y'see... 
The Animal Realm's just too small for me. 
Well, I'll be thanking you in advance.

Reimu:
I only have bad feelings about this......

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Marisa:
Who on earth is rampaging 
in this turbulent area of Hell?

Marisa (Wolf):
(......) 
(Hehehe...)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! I see pretending to be used by Kicchou paid off. 
Wolf spirit!

Marisa (Wolf):
......Yes! 
You overpraise me, Master Kurokoma.

Marisa:
Wha-Wait a second! 
I don't even know who you are!

Saki:
......You didn't tell the human about me, huh.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
of the Keiga Family.

Marisa:
The Keiga Family......?

Marisa (Wolf):
(This person here's my boss.) 
(The Keiga Family is an organization of animal spirits 
who pride themselves over their strong arms, swift legs and infinite courage.) 
(They're the strongest group in the Animal Realm, y'know.)

Marisa:
She's your boss? Huh. 
I see.

Saki:
So our brief deal with Kicchou in order to 
defeat Keiki has ended as well. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's‚Äî 
the Keiga Family's‚Äîworld. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Marisa:
I kinda get it. 
I'm glad. 
I won't need to hesitate 
if the invader is so obvious! 
You were the one who was trying 
to invade the surface! 
I'll beat you up right now!

Saki:
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice. 
Unlike that foul Kicchou, 
I happen to like fighting!

Marisa (Wolf):
......

Saki:
Do you hear me? Wolf spirit, 
you will do all you can to help this human and come at me! 
It won't be fun if she's 
not as strong as when she defeated Keiki.
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Marisa:
If you understand how strong I am, 
then you'll stop the invasion!

Saki:
Got it, I'll back off for now. 
Welp, in any case ruling over the Human Realm 
will have to wait till after we conquer the Animal Realm.

Marisa:
Conquering the Animal Realm...... 
I don't have to stop that, right?

Marisa (Wolf):
We of the Keiga Family 
were the strongest in the Animal Realm to begin with. 
Since you defeated Keiki, 
there's no longer anyone in our way.

Marisa:
Hmm, but......

Saki:
What is it?

Marisa:
It doesn't feel like 
I defeated that Keiki person at all. 
Maybe she has more up her sleeve......

Saki:
It'll be fine, it'll be fine. 
I don't really have a reason for it, but I'm not scared of her anymore. 
I'm sure Kicchou's 
gonna do something. 
But being unstoppable once we start attacking 
is one of our special features.

Marisa:
Hey, wolf spirit... 
Ain't your boss kinda empty-headed?

Marisa (Wolf):
Yeah, I'm sorry about that. 
It is as you've seen, she is physically strong,
but her intellect is a bit...

Marisa:
I got no idea what the politics of the Animal Realm are like...... 
But I can hardly imagine this family o'yours ruling it. 
There's no denyin' you guys are strong, but......

Saki:
What is it?

Marisa:
Keiki strikes me as the most dangerous person. 
Somehow it seems like she can come at us with all her power again.

Saki:
You think so? Well if that happens,
you'll go defeat her again for me, right?

Marisa:
See, that's what I mean. 
You aren't thinkin' at all, are ya?

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Marisa:
Who on earth is rampaging 
in this turbulent area of Hell?

Marisa (Otter):
(......I wondered who it was, 
seems my suspicion was right.) 
(This aura of a tremendous power points 
to that person!)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! Human! 
Show your face at once!

Marisa (Otter):
(It's really you, Master Kurokoma! 
Why are you doing this!?)

Marisa:
Wha-Wait a second! 
I don't even know who you are!

Saki:
......I see. 
So the animal spirit did not tell you about me.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Marisa:
The Keiga Family......?

Marisa (Otter):
(This person here is the boss of our enemy.) 
(The Keiga Family is a beastly organization 
full of muscleheads whose only redeeming quality is their strength.)

Marisa:
(A musclehead organization, huh?)

Saki:
The one possessing you 
is an otter spirit from Kicchou's gang right? 
Our brief deal with Kicchou in order to 
defeat Keiki has ended as well. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's‚Äî 
the Keiga Family's‚Äîworld. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm, and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Marisa (Otter):
Wh-What to do? 
Master Kurokoma's being so aggressive...... 
We have to go and report to Master Kicchou now!

Marisa:
Don't panic, otter spirit. 
Now's not time to retreat, right? 
It's not like we can't leave 
this person to do whatever she pleases. 
This one's a dangerous bastard! 
We have to defeat her now!

Saki:
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice. 
Unlike that foul Kicchou, 
I happen to like fighting!

Marisa (Otter):
Human...... No, Marisa Kirisame. 
You're courageous! I shall cooperate with you!

Saki:
Otter spirit of the Kiketsu Family! 
I see you've found a good human! 
But I'll have you know that I'm strong. 
Hold nothing back and come at me! 
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Marisa:
Oof, she's strong...... 
I can't let someone like this go up to the surface‚Äî

Saki:
In consideration of your strength, 
I'll back off the invasion for now. 
Even I don't want to turn it 
into a war of endurance, after all.

Marisa:
Thank god......

Saki:
Guess I'll have to conquer the Animal Realm 
before I move on to the Human Realm, then. 
The Kiketsu Family lead by Kicchou, 
and the Gouyoku Alliance lead by Toutetsu... 
There's also the Primate Spirit Garden controlled by Keiki, 
and then there's the unidentified and despicable hidden organization...... 
It'll be worthwhile defeating any one of them. 
Fufufu, this is getting fun.

Marisa:
Hey~ otter spirit~ 
Ain't she bad news......

Marisa (Otter):
Oh, so you felt it too? 
The Keiga Family simply loves violence. 
They're just a violent organization. 
That's why their leader has nothing good to offer either.

Marisa:
Well, I guess it only makes sense 
that the beast would be beastly. 
Is the Animal Realm full of people like this? 
Can't say I care for that.

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Marisa:
Who on earth is rampaging 
in this turbulent area of Hell?

Marisa (Eagle):
(......I wondered who it was, 
so it really is her.) 
(This unconcealed aura 
can only be her!)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! Human! 
Show your face at once!

Marisa (Eagle):
(It really is Kurokoma! 
She's so conceited. It pisses me off.)

Marisa:
Wha-Wait a second! 
I don't even know who you are!?

Saki:
......I see. 
So the animal spirit did not tell you about me.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Marisa:
The Keiga Family......?

Marisa (Eagle):
This person is the sworn enemy of the Gouyoku Alliance. 
She's the leader of a violent group 
who have nothing to boast of, not even their lifestyle.

Marisa:
(A violent...... group, huh. 
I see, she's shady.)

Saki:
The one possessing you 
is an eagle spirit from Toutetsu's gang, right? 
To think the prideful Gouyoku Alliance would 
cooperate with Kiketsu Family, how unexpected. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's‚Äî 
the Keiga Family's‚Äîworld. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm, and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Marisa (Eagle):
Don't be ridiculous. 
That would never happen! 
No, it might be possible 
for the violent leader of the Keiga Family!

Marisa:
I see, it's just as you've said, 
she's bad news. 
it's not like I can leave her alone. 
I'll defeat you right now!

Saki:
Heh heh heh, that sounds nice. 
Unlike that foul Kicchou, 
I happen to like fighting!

Marisa (Eagle):
Human...... I'll lend you my power! 
Let's stop the violent leader's rampage together!

Saki:
Eagle spirit of the Gouyoku Alliance! 
I see you've found a good human! 
But I'll have you know that I'm strong. 
Hold nothing back and come at me! 
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Marisa:
She seems like she can still go...... 
This one's crazy!

Saki:
Whew, I've had enough today. 
In consideration of your strength, 
I'll stop the invasion for now. 
I'd like to avoid wasting energy too.

Marisa:
Well, that's good.

Saki:
Oh, but I'm still gonna go to the surface for personal reasons.

Marisa:
Hm?

Saki:
The human spirits in the Animal Realm are so weak 
that they're being preserved as endangered species. 
But a human of flesh and blood was able 
to defeat the wicked god that we can't even touch. 
I want to know the reason behind that power.

Marisa:
Actually, that might just be because 
I'm a bit stronger than average.

Saki:
If that's the case, then I'm counting on you 
to spar with me when I come up to visit.

Marisa:
Ugh, w-well, that's fine. 
Come to my place if you ever come up here. 
Not the shrine, got it?

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Youmu:
Coastal operations in Hell, 
this is the first time I've seen it. 
Someone real bad must've appeared......

Youmu (Wolf):
(......) 
(Hehehe...)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! I see pretending to be used by Kicchou paid off. 
Wolf spirit!

Youmu (Wolf):
......Yes! 
You overpraise me, Master Kurokoma.

Youmu:
You are the strongest animal spirit......! 
Just who are you?

Saki:
......This human doesn't know of me, huh.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Youmu:
The Keiga Family......?

Youmu (Wolf):
This person here's my boss. 
The Keiga Family is an organization of animal spirits 
who pride themselves over their strong arms, swift legs and infinite courage. 
They're the strongest group in the Animal Realm, y'know.

Youmu:
The strongest in the Animal Realm!?

Saki:
So our brief deal with Kicchou in order to 
defeat Keiki has ended as well. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's‚Äî 
the Keiga Family's‚Äîworld. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Youmu:
In other words, since I defeated that god, 
people like you started to show up. 
I have to 
take responsibility! 
I have a duty to stop you, 
even if I bet on my life!

Saki:
Heh heh, just what I like to hear. 
Unlike that two-faced Kicchou. 
you are determined and elegant.

Youmu (Wolf):
......

Saki:
Do you hear me? Wolf spirit, 
you will do all you can to help this human and come at me! 
It won't be fun if she's 
not as strong as when she defeated Keiki.
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Youmu:
I can still go on!

Saki:
No, let's stop here. 
If we keep going at it, one of us will fall.

Youmu:
......*pant pant*, thank god. 
I couldn't hold on anymore.

Saki:
You're an upstanding fellow. 
I'm interested in ya. 
By the way, you... 
You're not a human from the surface, are you?

Youmu:
Yes, I'm a resident of the Netherworld.

Saki:
I see, the Netherworld. 
Indeed, that would explain why 
you were so good at manipulating the souls. 
Yup, I've decided! 
I'll try heading to the Netherworld next time.

Youmu:
Huh?

Saki:
If I can gain supporters in the Netherworld, 
the Keiga Family would get even stronger!

Youmu:
Bu-But... 
But if you do that, 
I'll have to beat you up again!

Saki:
Ahaha, just what I wanted, right!? 
Well then, get some rest, 
and we shall fight again!

Youmu:
Ha... Wha... 
I feel like I completely lost control of the conversation.

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Youmu:
Coastal operations in Hell, 
this is the first time I've seen it. 
Someone real bad must've appeared......

Youmu (Otter):
(......I wondered who it was, 
seems my suspicion was right.) 
(This aura of tremendous might points 
to that person!)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! Human! 
Show your face at once!

Youmu (Otter):
It's really you, Master Kurokoma! 
Why are you doing this!?

Youmu:
You are the strongest animal spirit......! 
Just who are you?

Saki:
......I see. 
So the animal spirit did not tell you about me.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Youmu:
The Keiga Family......?

Youmu (Otter):
(This person here is the boss of our enemy.) 
(The Keiga Family is a beastly organization 
full of muscleheads whose only redeeming quality is their strength.)

Youmu:
A beastly beast......

Saki:
The one possessing you 
is an otter spirit from Kicchou's gang, right? 
Our brief deal with Kicchou in order to 
defeat Keiki has ended as well. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's‚Äî 
the Keiga Family's‚Äîworld. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm, and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Youmu (Otter):
Wh-What to do? 
Master Kurokoma's being so aggressive...... 
We have to go and report to Master Kicchou now!

Youmu:
Otter spirit, 
don't run away! 
This is the opportune moment to take her down, 
while Hell is still undergoing coastal operations. 
I won't let this chance slip by! 
I'll cut your ambitions into pieces!

Saki:
Heh heh, just what I like to hear. 
Unlike that two-faced Kicchou, 
you are determined and elegant.

Youmu (Otter):
Swordswoman of the Netherworld...... No, Youmu Konpaku. 
Indeed, we will not retreat this time!

Saki:
Otter spirit of the Kiketsu Family! 
I see you've found a good human! 
But I'll have you know that I'm strong. 
Hold nothing back and come at me! 
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Youmu:
I can still go on!

Saki:
No, let's stop here. 
If we keep going at it, one of us will fall.

Youmu:
......*pant pant*, thank god. 
I couldn't hold on anymore.

Saki:
You're an upstanding fellow. 
I'm interested in ya. 
However, I cannot understand 
how you were able to defeat Keiki. 
Even though none of us 
were able to even touch her.

Youmu (Otter):
Fufufu. 
Master Kicchou discovered a way, 
and I just carried it out.

Saki:
Ugh.

Youmu (Otter):
What I mean is that even if you have power, 
that doesn't mean that you're truly strong. 
Am I right, partner?

Youmu:
When did I become your partner?

Saki:
I-I'm not frustrated or anythin'! 
No matter what schemes you pull, 
power is the only thing that guarantees victory. 
Feel it on your skin, the rule of beasts! 
Violence is what wins in the end!

Youmu:
What an unpleasant world.

Kutaka:
The area up ahead is occupied by the strongest animal spirit. 
Right now, we're carrying out coastal operations, 
in order to prevent her from attacking the surface. 
Please turn back now!

Youmu:
Coastal operations in Hell, 
this is the first time I've seen it. 
Someone real bad must've appeared......

Youmu (Eagle):
(This unconcealed aura 
can only be her!)

???:
Ohohoho! 
I can't stop laughing!

Saki:
Thanks to that bastard Kicchou defeating Keiki, 
we can finally act freely! 
Excellent work! Human! 
Show your face at once!

Youmu (Eagle):
(It really is Kurokoma! 
She's so conceited. It pisses me off.)

Youmu:
You are the strongest animal spirit......! 
Just who are you?

Saki:
......I see. 
So the animal spirit did not tell you about me.

Saki:
How rude of me. I am Saki Kurokoma, 
Boss of the Keiga Family.

Youmu:
The Keiga Family......?

Youmu (Eagle):
This person is the sworn enemy of the Gouyoku Alliance. 
She's the leader of a violent group 
who have nothing to boast of, not even their lifestyle.

Youmu:
Huh~, so there are all kinds of 
organizations in the Animal Realm.

Saki:
The one possessing you 
is an eagle spirit from Toutetsu's gang, right? 
To think the prideful Gouyoku Alliance would 
cooperate with Kiketsu Family, how unexpected. 
Thanks to you defeating Keiki, 
the Animal Realm has once again returned to being a competitive society. 
And thus, the strongest, fastest army's‚Äî 
the Keiga Family's‚Äîworld. 
Soon the Animal Realm shall 
come under the Keiga Family's possession. 
Perhaps more than the Animal Realm, and into Hell and the Human Realm too......? 
My dreams are broadening.

Youmu (Eagle):
Don't be ridiculous. 
That would never happen! 
No, it might be possible 
for the violent leader of the Keiga Family!

Youmu:
Eagle spirit, there is no need to panic. 
I came here with the intention of 
stopping the animal spirit in the first place. 
In other words, my original enemy 
has showed up before me. 
This is what exactly 
what I moved out for!

Saki:
Heh heh, just what I like to hear. 
Unlike that two-faced Kicchou, 
you are determined and elegant.

Youmu (Eagle):
Human...... I'll lend you my power! 
Let's stop the violent leader's rampage together!

Saki:
Eagle spirit of the Gouyoku Alliance! 
I see you've found a good human! 
But I'll have you know that I'm strong. 
Hold nothing back and come at me! 
Now, show this pitch black pegasus 
the power of the human who defeated the wicked god!

Saki:
......*pant pant* 
Such power and swiftness, along with bravery and wisdom fitting of your danmaku, 
the overall balance is great! 
I... I was moved!

Youmu:
I can still go on!

Saki:
No, let's stop here. 
If we keep going at it, one of us will fall.

Youmu:
......*pant pant*, thank god. 
I couldn't hold on anymore.

Saki:
You're an upstanding fellow. 
I'm interested in ya. 
However, eagle spirit. 
There is something I don't understand regarding you. 
Why did the Gouyoku Alliance agree on 
cooperating with Kicchou to defeat Keiki?

Youmu (Eagle):
...... 
I have no need to tell you about this.

Saki:
Then let me guess. 
The low-profile Gouyoku Alliance wants to join efforts with the Kiketsu Family, 
and surpass the Keiga Family (us) , or something.

Youmu (Eagle):
That's not it. My master, Toutetsu, 
has no interest in the Kiketsu Family, nor the Keiga Family.

Saki:
Which would mean that...... 
You want to monopolize the Primate Spirit Garden? 
That or the unidentified dark organization, huh? 
Either way, your avarice knows no bounds.

Youmu (Eagle):
I'll leave it up to your imagination.

Youmu:
Heeey. 
You guys are kinda leaving me behind...

Saki:
Oh, my apologies. 
As an apology, let's have another fight, how's about it?

Youmu:
I don't want that either, 
just don't ignore me.

Marisa:
...Just regular water, eh?
I panicked when black water started 
gushing out here and there,
but this area doesn't seem to be affected by the stuff.
Guess that means the source isn't in the forest...

Marisa:
Oh, if it isn't Reimu! 
What's up?

Reimu:
I decided to go underground to find out 
where the water's coming from.

Marisa:
I knew it. 
I thought you'd think to do that.

Reimu:
I heard that the Forest of Magic had an entrance to an underground 
cavern that hadn't been blocked by the black water.
You would know where that is, 
wouldn't you?

Marisa:
Actually, I was just about t' head 
down there and investigate myself.
I know. How 'bout the winner 
gets to go investigate first?

Reimu:
Good idea. 
I'm sure I'm gonna have to fight in flooded places anyways,
so you'll be the perfect practice for a fight!

Marisa:
It may come as a surprise, but I'm used to handling water.
Too bad for you! 
I'll be the one that goes to the underground cavern first!

Reimu:
Warm up complete! 
Gotta make sure to do warm up exercises before you go for a swim.

Marisa:
Oh. Welp, I kinda guessed this would happen.
Even so, we don't even know what this black water actually is. 
I'm gettin' a bad feeling from the underground.
Be careful.

Reimu:
It really is soaked, huh. 
I should've worn some boots before coming here.

Kogasa:
That outfit! 
You're looking down on the rain, aren't 'cha!?

Reimu:
Whoa, it's the umbrella youkai! 
That surprised me.

Kogasa:
If you don't have an umbrella, you'll 
never survive in a place where it rains!

Reimu:
Huh? It's stupid to prepare for 
rain even though we're in a cavern...

Kogasa:
Heehee. Rain can fall 
anytime and anywhere, you know.

Kogasa:
Just like this!

Reimu:
Whoa! 
It rained even though we're in a cavern!?

Kogasa:
See, I told you that you need an umbrella!
This is your punishment for slacking on preparation! 
Time for you to get even more drenched!

Kogasa:
I lost!

Reimu:
Rather than make it rain, 
didn't you just change your danmaku into water drops?

Kogasa:
Well, yeah. 
I've been looking into a bunch of stuff 
about the black water too, y'know...
Since I wondered if it's related 
to someone I know...

Reimu:
W-What!?

Kogasa:
Whoops, can't say any more than that. 
I'll be in danger myself if word gets out... y'know?

Reimu:
Ugh, what is this intense smell? 
It's not the black water, though...
I've smelled it on the surface before, 
this boiled egg-like scent...
I've smelled it on Youkai Mountain. 
I've smelled it at places where you can rest your fatigue.
Could it be? 
This heart-stirring place is...!?

Reimu:
A hot spring! 
There's even a whole town!
So the underground even has places like this too... 
It's not just snowing ghost towns after all.

Yuugi:
Oh, Miss Reimu. 
What brings you here today?

Reimu:
You're... Yuugi! 
That oni from Former Hell.

Yuugi:
Yep, and the boss of this here hot spring town.

Reimu:
Oh, so it really is a hot spring! 
Score...!

Yuugi:
What's that? 
Ya came here without knowing that it's a hot spring?
Well, whatever. 
Anyway, I'm askin' you about why you came here.

Reimu:
I came here for the hot... That's not it.
The black water came from the underground...

Yuugi:
...I see. So stinky black water 
is springin' up on the surface.

Reimu:
It should be coming from the underground...
But the only thing gushing out here 
is stinky white spring water, huh.

Yuugi:
Heh heh heh. I reckon I know what 
that black water really is.

Reimu:
Huh?

Yuugi:
That black water gushes up from a zone that's considered 
untouchable, even by Former Hell standards.
It's an utterly cursed liquid.

Reimu:
So it really is Former Hell's water.

Yuugi:
They say that if you're careful with how you 
use it, it can bring you great wealth...
But it's also said that those who obtain it 
are guaranteed to meet with misfortune.
What'd they call it in the human world, again...?
They wrote it as "stone oil"... 
"Petroleum," I think it was called.

Reimu:
Pettrohlium...?

Yuugi:
I've got no clue as to why it's 
gushing out onto the surface, though.

Reimu:
I see, thanks for the information. 
I guess I'll have to go check it out for myself after all.
How do I get to this 
"untouchable zone"?

Yuugi:
Don't be stupid. 
I told you it's untouchable.

Reimu:
That wouldn't solve anything. 
Take me there.

Yuugi:
Heh heh. Makin' light of me, are ya? 
There's no way I'd let you expose any more of Former Hell's secrets.
Go home to the surface before you get hurt!

Yuugi:
You're good!
This is the best hot spring town around. 
Even if you get hurt real bad, I'm sure you'll heal up right away.
So I may as well come at'cha 
with everything I've got!

Yuugi:
Huff, huff... 
I see you have no mind to turn back...

Reimu:
That's because nothing would be solved 
if I turned back here.

Yuugi:
Well, I guess...
If you're so determined to go, then just go.
The black water sleeps somewhere 
far deeper than here.
However, you must keep what you see ahead of here a secret.

Reimu:
I got it. 
I'll try not to say too much.
So, by the way...
Can I take a dip in the hot springs after all? 
I'm feeling a bit tired.

Yuugi:
Go ahead, go ahead.
Kick back an' relax in the worst hot spring town around, 
filled with vengeful spirits from corner to corner.

Marisa:
...Just regular water, eh?
I panicked when black water started 
gushing out here and there,
but this area doesn't seem to be affected by the stuff.
Guess that means the source isn't in the forest...

Marisa:
Oh, if it isn't Reimu! 
What's up?

Reimu:
I decided to go underground to find out 
where the water's coming from.

Marisa:
I knew it. 
I thought you'd think to do that.

Reimu:
I heard that the Forest of Magic had an entrance to an underground 
cavern that hadn't been blocked by the black water.
You would know where that is, 
wouldn't you?

Marisa:
Actually, I was just about t' head 
down there and investigate myself.
I know. How 'bout the winner 
gets to go investigate first?

Reimu:
Good idea. 
I'm sure I'm gonna have to fight in flooded places anyways,
so you'll be the perfect practice for a fight!

Marisa:
It may come as a surprise, but I'm used to handling water.
Too bad for you! 
I'll be the one that goes to the underground cavern first!

Marisa:
Heck yeah, I win! 
I'm already good an' prepared.
I'm gonna head underground to investigate. 
You sit tight up here!

Marisa:
We don't know what the black water is, 
and we can't be sure if there's even an enemy down there.
Even so, we don't even know what this black water actually is. 
I'm gettin' a bad feeling from the underground. (sic)
Times like these often end up being wasted effort, 
so be careful down there.

Marisa:
This is my first time bein' in this cavern, but... 
It's a lot bigger than I thought.
I've heard rumors about it leadin' all the way 
to Former Hell... which just might be true.

Marisa:
D'oh!

Yamame:
Yes, gotcha! 
Today's prey is really big!
...Wait, Marisa?!

Marisa:
What the heck?! 
There's a spider livin' here.

Marisa:
Someone's gotta clean up the place, even in a cave!

Yamame:
You're pretty good 
at handling water.
But what about water that's not pure?

Yamame:
You're as strong as ever...
A failed capture!

Marisa:
If there's tsuchigumo crawlin' around here, 
then it's gotta lead to Former Hell after all.

Yamame:
You didn't know?
This is around the 5th largest 
corridor to Former Hell.

Marisa:
Huh?! Fifth?
Are there seriously that many 
paths leadin' there...?

Marisa:
This place stinks...
It's not the smell of the incident, but...
Is this smell sulfur?

Marisa:
Aha! It is a hot spring!
Seems like a fun, lively kinda place!

Yuugi:
That's not sulfur you're smelling, 
Miss Marisa.

Marisa:
'Ey, it's Yuugi.

Yuugi:
You above-grounders get the wrong idea about this a lot, 
but sulfur's not what gives hot springs their smell.

Marisa:
Really?

Yuugi:
It's the smell of the vengeful spirits' grudges, y'see.
Sulfur is actually odorless. 
You'd better remember that!
By the way, what brings y' here?

Marisa:
I'm actually here t'see about some stinky 
black water that smells different from this...

Yuugi:
...I see, so it's gushing up above ground.
Heh heh heh. You won't find any of that 
stuff around here, but I do know what it is.

Marisa:
Oho.

Yuugi:
That water comes from a zone that's considered 
untouchable, even by Former Hell standards.
It's an utterly cursed liquid.
They say that if you're careful with how you 
use it, it can bring you great wealth...
But it's also said that those who obtain it 
are guaranteed to meet with misfortune.
What'd they call it in the human world, again...?
They wrote it as "stone oil"... 
"Petroleum," I think it was called.

Marisa:
Petroleum? 
Yeah, I've heard of it.

Yuugi:
I've got no clue as to why it's 
gushing out onto the surface, though.

Marisa:
A'ight, sorry to bother you. 
Now, I'd like to take a dip in the hot spring...
But investigatin' the petroleum comes first.

Yuugi:
Hang on a sec. 
You're going off to investigate it?

Marisa:
'Course I am! 
The hot springs come after that!

Yuugi:
You'd better not. 
Digging any deeper than the city area is dangerous.
Not just for you, 
but for all of Former Hell!

Yuugi:
You're good!
This is the best hot spring town around. 
Even if you get hurt real bad, I'm sure you'll heal up right away.
So I may as well come at'cha 
with everything I've got!

Yuugi:
Huff, huff... 
I see you have no mind to turn back...

Marisa:
You told me 'bout the petroleum. It showed 
you aren't serious about stoppin' me, right?

Yuugi:
Heh heh.
The petroleum sleeps somewhere 
deeper than here.
But these days, there's no 
road leading down there.

Marisa:
Eh? 
What?

Yuugi:
There's some mysterious power 
keepin' the road blocked.
Well, just keep your wits about ya.

Reimu:
Good, the rain's stopped.
Now my investigation can really get underway.

???:
Hey, Sis! Yeah, you over there!

Mike:
I've got some nice cards! Wanna buy any?

Reimu:
Cards?! Looks like I've found my first clue already.

Mike:
Ooh, looks like I've got a bite.

Reimu:
It's dangerous to have those. Hand them over right now!

Mike:
Whaa? Are you sayin' you're gonna steal 'em by force?

Reimu:
Exactly! Those Ability Cards are the subject of my incident investigation.
Quit making excuses and hand them over!

Mike:
Ggh...! There's no point in attacking me!
But you won't be getting any Ability Cards through violence, that's for sure.
I need somethin' of value in return, right? That's the basis of the entire free market.

Reimu:
Alright, alright, I'll buy them like I'm supposed to. So, how much do they run for?

Mike:
...Heh heh heh. Now we're talking.

Reimu:
There's no telling what could be lurking this deep in the mountains...
Are there really any merchants hanging out in a place like this?

???:
Oh! Now that I get a good look at you, you're the Hakurei shrine maiden!
It's rare to see you this far off the beaten path.

Reimu:
You're... not a kappa. You're a yamawaro, right?

Takane:
Indeed! And as you may be aware, this cliff's a secret hideout for us yamawaro.
It's no place for humans to be skulking around. So get outta here, quick!

Reimu:
Hang on! Those are Ability Cards you're holding, right?

Takane:
Cards, eh...?
I guess you've been sniffing around for them after all.
Better dispose of you before you raise too much of a ruckus!

Takane:
Good grief, you're strong...
But it's too bad for you!
Cards can't be taken through violence. Those are the rules.

Reimu:
Alright, alright.
I don't know why there's some rule like that, but I'll buy them.
In exchange, you'll tell me all the information you know!

Takane:
Ooh! If you're a customer, then that's quite a different story!
Speaking of information, there's actually one more rule when it comes to buying and selling cards.
You can only buy one card with each transaction. Apparently, you get in BIG trouble if you break this rule.

Reimu:
...Thanks for the valuable info.

Takane:
Now, go right ahead! They're all very valuable products.

???:
The hell's all this racket...?

???:
Get lost! You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

???:
You followed me all this way, huh?
Guess you're not just some ordinary rioter...

Reimu:
Who are you...? And where is this?

Sannyo:
My name's Sannyo. Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.
You're that shrine maiden from down below, right? Nice job making it this far.

Reimu:
I was chasing after card merchants, and eventually I just wound up here.
So, what's that thing behind you? Looks like some sort of entrance.

Sannyo:
Heh heh heh. Wanna know?
'Course, I've got no intention of telling you. Entry's prohibited past this point.

Reimu:
A mysterious entrance up on such a high mountain plateau... It's suspicious! Too suspicious!

Sannyo:
So with that, I'd suggest beating a retreat if you don't want to get hurt.
You didn't see anything here. We clear on that?
And if you can't keep your mouth shut, I'll make sure you can't see anything.

Sannyo:
Grh. You're way too strong...

Reimu:
Hmph. Don't go thinking that you can hide anything from me.
So, what's that entrance? You're going to tell me.

Sannyo:
Alright, fine... I've gotta surrender.
This is the entrance to the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
In that cave is a mine full of dreams. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.
I've been watchin' over the place so that no outsiders wander too close.

Reimu:
Hmph. If they've posted a guard here, then they're probably up to no good!

Sannyo:
Nah, that ain't it.
I'm guarding the place... because it's really dangerous inside.

Reimu:
...Mmmm. Guess I'd better keep my wits about me.

Reimu:
Just how long does this cave go on for?
I never would've imagined it would be this deep from the entrance.

???:
You there, human! Stop at once!

Misumaru:
You'll die if you proceed any further.
I'm telling you this for your own good. Turn around and leave, right now!

Reimu:
I'll die...? You're kidding, right?
You're obviously trying to hide something from me!

Misumaru:
Sigh...
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

Reimu:
I won't be able to breathe...?
Then I'll just search the place top to bottom before that happens! 
I'll find all of this cavern's secrets!

Misumaru:
Honestly, now. I'm not even telling you this as a threat...
I can't afford to lose the inheritor of the Yin-Yang Orb to suffocation.
If we'll lose you either way, at least let it be by my hands!

Misumaru:
Splendid!
To think that the Yin-Yang Orb that I crafted has been mastered to such a degree.
It is an honor to the Tamatsukuri-be.

Reimu:
W-what are you saying...? I'm starting to feel faint.

Misumaru:
I told you, didn't I?
The oxygen levels here are already just about half of that on the surface.

Reimu:
W-what are you doing down here...?!

Misumaru:
This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.

Reimu:
...I want to hear more, b-but I can't take it any longer...
Dammit, this place was a total bust!
This is no place for humans to be!

Misumaru:
Indeed. Mining sites in general are a harsh environment for humans, not just here.
I suppose a price must be paid for stealing the resources of the gods.
By the way, you've come to investigate the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
Now go on back! O successor of the Yin-Yang Orb, Reimu Hakurei!

???:
A human's here! See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something like this up for long...!

Reimu:
The sun's plunged right on down by now.
It'll be hard to find anyone carrying cards at this rate.
Looks like my only choice is to try again some other time...

???:
Why, what's this? We seem to have an interesting guest.
Is something the matter, Miss Hakurei Shrine Maiden?

Reimu:
"Something?" Well, um, that is to say.

Megumu:
This stretch of mountain is the territory of we tengu.
It isn't a place that humans ought to set foot in so easily, shrine maiden or no.

Reimu:
You're a tengu, from the looks of it. There's something I'd like to ask you.

Megumu:
Oh? And what would that be?

Reimu:
Well, it's about this whole Ability Card business...
Back in that cave just now, I was told that there's someone who knows about them up on the mountaintop.
I came up here to investigate what those Ability Cards really are.
Anything you can tell me?

Megumu:
The Ability Cards? I don't just "know" about them.
I created them, as a matter of fact!

Reimu:
Huh? What?!

???:
There you are!

Tsukasa:
See, things turned out just like I said they would.
A human would be sure to come snooping up here eventually!
I suppose we have no choice by now. I shall deal with this human myself.
So in the meantime, Master Iizunamaru, you can...

Megumu:
Ah-hah-hah! Don't get ahead of yourself.
As if I could let you deal with her, of all people!
Our opponent is the eminent Hakurei Shrine Maiden, who has buried countless innocent youkai until this day.
I'll deal with her. You get back!

Megumu:
Heh heh. Splendid.
I hereby surrender. As such, any further conflict is futile.

Reimu:
How very straightforward of you. Now, tell me about those cards!

Megumu:
As I said before, I'm the one who made the cards.
I figured I could make a good profit using the dragon gems dug up from the Rainbow Dragon Cave, you know?
I've made enough money off of them by now, so I was guessing it'd be about time to pack up shop anyway.
But just so you know, I can't stop the cards from circulating by myself.

Reimu:
What? Why?

Megumu:
Because everyone who's taking part in the card trade just started doing so of their own accord.
And I'm not the one controlling their circulation, either.

Reimu:
Augh! It's just been one thing after another today, hasn't it!

Megumu:
The world of commerce is a complex one.
If you do seriously want to stop the cards' circulation...
I suggest you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.

Reimu:
Fine, got it! I just have to go up there, right?!

Tsukasa:
...Are you alright with this? Letting her leave, and reach that god?

Megumu:
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned, and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
Getting sorely beaten by the shrine maiden will serve her right.

Tsukasa:
....Hahaha. I see.
That simpleton of a shrine maiden ought to do a proper job for us.

Tsukasa:
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

Reimu:
What a huge moon!
It feels like something's about to pop out, but...
Don't tell me that fox just now is the mastermind or something, right?

???:
Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

Reimu:
...Who?

Chimata:
Chimata Tenkyuu. I'm the market's main presenter.

Reimu:
The market's presenter? So you're...

Chimata:
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're all able to buy and sell goods.
Put another way, you're essentially alive right now because of me.

Reimu:
Okay...? I don't totally follow.

Tsukasa:
Miss Chimata. I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

Chimata:
What? Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah! It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

Tsukasa:
By which you mean?

Chimata:
I always knew that she was taking advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize that I was taking advantage of her right back!

Tsukasa:
Oho. How very interesting.

Chimata:
You're Iizunamaru's pet, aren't you? Trot on back and tell her.
The market is already open.
None can escape from the hands of God!

Reimu:
Helloooo?
You've been talking for way too long!

Chimata:
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot.
Well then, shall we begin?

Reimu:
Huh? Begin what?

Chimata:
What do you mean, "what"...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

Reimu:
Sell them?
No way! I'm here to investigate the cards.
I'm thinking that once I figure out what they really are, I'll confiscate them all.
I'll never get a good night's sleep with these cards making the rounds!

Chimata:
I see... You're trying to monopolize the cards with no exchange of currency.
So, you were a robber seeking to destroy the marketplace? I certainly can't let that slide.

Tsukasa:
Miss Reimu Hakurei. Miss Chimata is a god of the marketplace, and of commerce.
Angering her would be nothing but disadvantageous for you.
I think it would be best if you simply sold a card, and received a set profit for it.

Reimu:
Argh, will everyone quit blathering on?!
I've been steaming mad from the very start, having these weird cards get made from me!
I don't know about you being a marketplace god or whatever,
but if that's what you really are, take those cards out of circulation, right now!

Tsukasa:
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

Chimata:
How unfortunate...
A robber who refuses to understand bartering has no right to enter the marketplace.
Allow me to liberate all of your possessions!
Let your pockets be stripped bare, and painfully realize this fact:
Humans were always poor creatures who can own nothing at all!

Chimata:
Hey...
That card you're holding... It's mine...?!

Reimu:
I got ahold of it just a minute ago. It's the most utterly useless Ability Card of all!

Chimata:
"Useless?" Excuse you! It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
What an utterly interesting robber! It's a shame that you're going to die here!

Chimata:
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) ! This marks the end!

Marisa:
Man, that was some awful rain.
Weather near the mountain really does change fast.

???:
Hey, Sis! Yeah, you over there!

Mike:
I've got some nice cards! Wanna buy any?

Marisa:
Cards? You mean these mysterious little Ability Cards?

Mike:
Ooh, looks like I've got a bite.

Marisa:
Those cards are dangerous items. They sure ain't cat toys, I can tell you that much.

Mike:
Hmph! You might say that... but you want 'em too, don'tcha?
And they're not dangerous or anything. I mean, everyone's collecting 'em!

Marisa:
"Everyone's collecting 'em"? Looks like things have gotten pretty serious.
Looks like I'll start by investigating your cards!

Mike:
Ggh...! There's no point in attacking me!
But you won't be getting any Ability Cards through violence, that's for sure.
I need somethin' of value in return, right? That's the basis of the entire free market.

Marisa:
The free market? Are you saying that everyone's buyin' and sellin' those cards?

Mike:
Duh, of course! So, are you gonna buy? Or aren't ya?

Marisa:
O-okay, fine. I'll buy 'em. I'll buy 'em! How much are they?

Mike:
...Heh heh heh. Now we're talking.

Marisa:
According to that cat, the cards originated from the Youkai Mountain...
But this is my first time visitin' this area. It's sheer cliffs all around...

???:
Oh! You're a human after all.
I thought I'd mistaken what you were, back there.

Marisa:
Bingo. Looks like the cat wasn't lyin'.

Takane:
This cliff is a secret hideout for we, the yamawaro.
It's no place for humans to be skulking around. So get outta here, quick!

Marisa:
Pretty lucky for me to have found someone with cards on 'em this quick.

Takane:
Cards, eh...?
I guess you've been sniffing around for them after all.
These are too much for you puny little humans to handle! Begone from our mountain!

Takane:
Good grief, you're strong...
But it's too bad for you!
Cards can't be taken through violence. Those are the rules.

Marisa:
Ya can't take cards through violence... That cat said the same thing.
Hearin' that makes me feel too guilty to steal the things.
Welp, alright. I'll buy one. First I'll buy, then I'll investigate.
How much you want?

Takane:
Ooh! If you're a customer, then that's quite a different story!
Now, go right ahead! They're all great deals!

???:
The hell's all this racket...?

???:
Get lost! You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

???:
You followed me all this way, huh?
Guess you're not just some ordinary rioter...

Marisa:
Who're you?

Sannyo:
My name's Sannyo. Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.
And who are you?

Marisa:
My name's Marisa Kirisame. Folks like to call me Genius Magician, though.

Sannyo:
Heheh.
So, what brings Miss Genius up to this mountaintop?

Marisa:
I'm huntin' down card merchants.
Looks like you've got some cards too, don'tcha?

Sannyo:
So it's cards you want, after all. I thought as much.

Sannyo:
If you want some, go buy 'em from a merchant in the foothills! Get lost right now.
You're 80 years too early to even think of buyin' from me!
And if you won't leave, I'll chase you off with brute force.

Sannyo:
Grh. You're way too strong...

Marisa:
It's not that I want the cards so much as I wanna know their secrets.
What are these cards? Who's making 'em?

Sannyo:
...You don't need to know about that.
Uh, actually, I don't know either. It's not somethin' I need to do business, after all.

Marisa:
R-really? Well, I guess the investigation continues.
By the way, what's that big, gaping thing behind you?

Sannyo:
This is... the entrance to the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
In that cave is a mine full of dreams. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.
It's dangerous inside, so I'm watchin' over the place.

Marisa:
Oho... intriguing. I'd better check this place out too.

Marisa:
Man, this cave is ridiculously deep.
Seein' this magic shining with rainbow light... I feel like I'm gonna dig up somethin' ridiculously good.

???:
You there, human! Stop at once!

Misumaru:
You'll die if you proceed any further.
I'm telling you this for your own good. Turn around and leave, right now!

Marisa:
Finally time for the bad guy to show up, eh?
You really kept me waiting! I thought I was gonna follow this tunnel all the way to Hell.

Misumaru:
Are you even listening? I'll warn you one more time.
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

Marisa:
I won't be able to breathe, huh?
Threats like that won't work on me!

Misumaru:
Honestly, now. I'm not even telling you this as a threat...
I'd rather not see this place be sullied with an ignorant human's corpse.
Will you leave on your own, or be carried out? Choose at once!

Misumaru:
Hm, not bad.
I certainly didn't expect you to be this strong.
Young Marisa Kirisame.

Marisa:
Y'know who I am...?
Gh, I can't... breathe...
Wh' th'hell are you doin'...?

Misumaru:
I told you, didn't I?
Even at this depth, the oxygen levels are already about half of that on the surface.

Marisa:
I-I give up... There's nothin' I can do if I can't breathe.
But tell me this one thing. What th' heck are ya diggin' for down here?

Misumaru:
This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.

Marisa:
...Izanagi Objects! You're gettin' magic items from the gods' era, then.
Dang, diggin' up stuff like that. I-I'm jealous.
Damn... I can't take another breath...

Misumaru:
By the way, you've come to investigate the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
I really do recommend taking some deep breaths up there.

???:
A human's here! See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something like this up for long...!

Marisa:
*Inhaaaale*...
Hwaaaaah...
Dang, yeah! Takin' deep breaths on a mountain is the best!

???:
Why, what's this? Out on a nighttime hike?
Or perhaps you're stranded?

Marisa:
Who're you?

Megumu:
I am the Great Tengu, Iizunamaru.
I have no interest in who you might be, human,
but this isn't a place that humans ought to set foot in so easily.

Marisa:
A Great Tengu... Man, I must've hiked pretty deep by now.
Well, I've got somethin' I wanna investigate. You got time to spare?

Megumu:
What might that be?

Marisa:
You know 'bout those Ability Card things? They're making the rounds down in the foothills.
You happen t' know anything about them?

Megumu:
The Ability Cards? I don't just "know" about them.
I created them, as a matter of fact!

Marisa:
Huh? What?!

???:
There you are!

Tsukasa:
See, things turned out just like I said they would.
A human would be sure to come snooping up here eventually!
I suppose we have no choice by now. I shall deal with this human myself.
So in the meantime, Master Iizunamaru, you can...

Megumu:
Ah-hah-hah! Don't get ahead of yourself.
You're too confident in your own strength, despite being a weakling.
If you got injured, I'd be the one troubled by it.
I'll deal with her. You get back!

Megumu:
Heh heh. Splendid.
I'm fond of brave, powerful people. I'll hear you out.

Marisa:
You said that you made the Ability Cards a minute ago, right?

Megumu:
Yes, that's right.
I figured I could make a good profit using the dragon gems dug up from the Rainbow Dragon Cave, you know?

Marisa:
Gotcha. I think I'm puttin' it together.
I've been noticing those rainbow lights here an' there for a little while now...
Those are all rainbows bein' projected by the dragon gems, right?

Megumu:
Indeed. You're quite the knowledgeable...

Marisa:
I thought it was weird that every single card was its own magic item.
If you dug 'em up from a magic mine, then it makes total sense.

Megumu:
So, what are you going to do now?

Marisa:
I'm investigating 'em out of pure curiosity!
That, plus the tiniest hint of wanting to hoard 'em.

Megumu:
Well, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.
I may have designed the cards, but they're out of my hands by now.
If you do seriously want to investigate their whereabouts, collect them, and so on...
I suggest you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.

Marisa:
I see... Got it!

Tsukasa:
...Are you alright with this? Letting her leave, and reach that god?

Megumu:
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned, and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
I'm sure that girl just now will do a good job for us.

Tsukasa:
....Hahaha. I see.
When you betray someone, you don't do it with your own hands.
A wonderful idea, in my opinion.

Tsukasa:
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

Marisa:
What a creepy moon.
There might be some kinda power at work here, too.

???:
Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

Marisa:
...And you are?

Chimata:
Chimata Tenkyuu. I'm the market's main presenter.

Marisa:
The market's presenter... So you're the card merchants' manager?

Chimata:
Well, I suppose that's not exactly wrong...
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're all able to buy and sell goods.
Put another way, you're essentially alive right now because of me.

Marisa:
I see...

Tsukasa:
Miss Chimata. I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

Chimata:
What? Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah! It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

Tsukasa:
By which you mean?

Chimata:
I always knew that she was taking advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize that I was taking advantage of her right back!

Tsukasa:
Oho. How very interesting.

Marisa:
Hey, mind if I butt in? You're the fox that was with that tengu down there, yeah?
Weren't you her minion or somethin'?

Tsukasa:
Yes, of course. Master Iizunamaru is the highest and only master I serve.
As Miss Chimata is my master's precious friend, I thought it best that we share information to ensure that none are at a disadvantage.
I believe it would be best for you, too, to avoid angering Miss Chimata.

Marisa:
Wow, you sound shady as hell. Makes sense for a fox.
Whatever, though. I finally found the one who's putting the cards on the market.

Chimata:
*Giggle*. So, shall we begin?

Marisa:
Begin? Begin what?

Chimata:
What do you mean, "what"...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

Marisa:
Sell 'em?
Nah, that ain't it. I'm here to stop you all from sellin' em.
Everyone's getting weirded out, having cards of 'em made without them knowing!

Chimata:
I see...
So, you were a robber seeking to destroy the marketplace? I certainly can't let that slide.
The fact that robbers like you exist is the reason why peace can never arrive.

Tsukasa:
Whoops, looks like you made her mad.
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

Chimata:
You foul barbarian...
How long are you going to believe that you can use violence to hold dominion over objects?
Possession of an object can only be controlled by the god of the markets.
As long as they possess something, none can escape from the hands of God!
The market has been opened! Let us return all things to nothing (God) !

Chimata:
...You.
That card you're holding... It's mine...?!

Marisa:
Oh, yeah. I got a dud foisted on me. It's the most utterly useless Ability Card around!

Chimata:
"Useless?" Excuse you! It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
What an utterly interesting robber! It's a shame that you're going to die here!

Chimata:
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) ! This marks the end!

Sakuya:
Why, it's a rainbow.
I'd love to show this to Milady as well.

???:
Hey, Sis! Yeah, you over there!

Mike:
I've got some nice cards! Wanna buy any?

Sakuya:
I'm fine, thank you... Wait, cards?!
Do you mean these mysterious Ability Cards?

Mike:
Looks like you've got some too, Sis.

Mike:
That makes things nice an' easy. I've got some rare cards lined up here! Better act fast.

Sakuya:
...*Chuckle*. I'll be taking all your cards, if you don't mind.

Mike:
Huh?!

Sakuya:
There's no point in letting blockheads like you have something so valuable.
If you don't want to get hurt, fork them over right now!

Mike:
Ggh...! There's no point in attacking me!
But you won't be getting any Ability Cards through violence, that's for sure.
I need somethin' of value in return, right? That's the basis of the entire free market.

Sakuya:
*Chuckle*. I suppose so. I'll pay full price, so give me everything you have.

Mike:
Pleasure doin' business with you! ...Is what I'd like to say.
But you can only buy one card per transaction. Didn'tcha know that?

Sakuya:
Huh? Why's that...?

Mike:
Beats me. I heard it's somethin' the bigwigs decided.

Sakuya:
Hmm... Thank you very much for the useful information.

Sakuya:
It's been a while since I climbed up the mountain by myself.
I hardly expected the Youkai Mountain to have such a perfect sheer cliff for rock-climbing.

???:
Oh! You're a human after all.
I thought I'd mistaken what you were, back there.

Sakuya:
Oh. A kappa?

Takane:
I'm a yamawaro, not a kappa! A yamawaro. We're pretty similar, though.
This is no place for humans to be skulking around. So get outta here, quick!

Sakuya:
I'm afraid that won't be happening.
After all, I can see that you've got cards of your own.

Takane:
Cards, eh...?
I guess you've been sniffing around for them after all.
These are too much for you puny little humans to handle! Begone from our mountain!

Takane:
Good grief, you're strong...
But it's too bad for you!
Cards can't be taken through violence. Those are the rules.

Sakuya:
Nobody said anything about taking them via violence. If you want money, I have it.

Takane:
Ooh! If you're a customer, then that's quite a different story!
Honestly, you should've said that first.

Sakuya:
You're the one who got the wrong idea and attacked me.
I had always intended to purchase them.

Takane:
I do beg your pardon~! Here you go. They're all only available now!

???:
The hell's all this racket...?

???:
Get lost! You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

???:
You followed me all this way, huh?
Guess you're not just some ordinary rioter...

Sakuya:
And who might you be?

Sannyo:
My name's Sannyo. Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.
And who are you?

Sakuya:
I'm searching for card merchants at the moment.
I imagine you're selling cards as well?

Sannyo:
Heheh.
Your name first, if you don't mind.

Sakuya:
I do apologize.
I'm Sakuya Izayoi. I work as a maid at the Scarlet Devil Mansion

Sannyo:
Bahaha! I got the feeling you weren't someone to sneeze at.
But you're just some human maid?

Sannyo:
If you want some, go buy 'em from a merchant in the foothills! Get lost right now.
You're 80 years too early to even think of buyin' from me!
And if you won't leave, I'll chase you off with brute force.

Sannyo:
Grh. You're way too strong...
I get it, I get it. You're strong. I'll sell ya some cards.

Sakuya:
Why, thank you.
By the way, where might that entrance behind you happen to lead?

Sannyo:
This? It's the entrance to the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
It's a cave with a mine full of dreams in it. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.

Sakuya:
Rainbow Dragon Cave... A mine...
This is the first I've heard of it. Are you digging for coal, perhaps?

Sannyo:
Hey, hey, you can't go in there. It's more dangerous than you'd ever believe!

Sakuya:
Thank you for the heads-up.

Sannyo:
Well, if you insist on goin' in...
What do you say? I've got some pretty good cards.

Sakuya:
This mine shaft is far too long...
No matter how far I go, it all looks the same, too...
*Gasp!* Could I be looping in place?!

???:
You there, human! Stop at once!

Misumaru:
You'll die if you proceed any further.
I'm telling you this for your own good. Turn around and leave, right now!

Sakuya:
I suppose I'm not looping, then.

Misumaru:
Looping... True, this shaft certainly is long enough to feel endless.
But that's nothing more than someone's insatiable desire, taken form.
I'll warn you one more time.
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

Sakuya:
Anoxic, you say?
...Remind me what "oxygen" is?

Misumaru:
Oxygen is a curse placed on animals, which causes them to instantly die in its absence.
An anoxic zone is a sanctuary that's protected from animals' intrusion.
You're bound to die of suffocation there too, but I really suggest dying in a more pleasant way, you know?

Misumaru:
Hm, not bad.
I certainly didn't expect you to be this strong.
Young Sakuya Izayoi.

Sakuya:
?! How do you know... who I am...?
But I've walked right into a trap. I can't breathe...

Misumaru:
I told you you'd suffocate, yes?
The oxygen levels here are already just about half of that on the surface.

Sakuya:
So this is the curse on this place... Let me ask one last thing.
...What are you digging up here?

Misumaru:
This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.
I happen to craft genuine magatamas from these dragon gems.
The "tama" in "magatama" refers to a human's soul. As such, they can seal humans' abilities within them...

Sakuya:
...Y-you're really droning on. I can't even tell what you're saying any more...

Misumaru:
Oh, my sincerest apologies.
By the way, you've come to investigate the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
I really do recommend taking some deep breaths up there.

???:
A human's here! See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something like this up for long...!

Sakuya:
It's this late already...
I wasted too much time in that dud of a cave.
Now that it's dark, descending the mountain will also be dangerous.
Time to set up camp here for the night.

???:
Why, what's this? Out on a nighttime hike?
Or perhaps you're stranded?

Sakuya:
And you are?

Megumu:
I am the Great Tengu, Iizunamaru.
I have no interest in who you might be, human,
but this isn't a place that humans ought to set foot in so easily.

Sakuya:
Oh, is that so.
So the one making a profit off of magatama, who that woman from before mentioned...
They're a tengu, aren't they?

Megumu:
Are you talking about the Ability Cards?

Sakuya:
Ummm. Probably.

Megumu:
Well, I actually happened to create those cards.

Sakuya:
Huh? Excuse me?!

???:
There you are!

Tsukasa:
See, things turned out just like I said they would.
A human would be sure to come snooping up here eventually!
I suppose we have no choice by now. I shall deal with this human myself.
So in the meantime, Master Iizunamaru, you can...

Megumu:
Ah-hah-hah! Don't get ahead of yourself.
You're too confident in your own strength, despite being a weakling.
If you got injured, I'd be the one troubled by it.
I'll deal with her. You get back!

Megumu:
Heh heh. Splendid.
I'm fond of brave, powerful people. I'll hear you out.

Sakuya:
Are you really the one who made the Ability Cards?

Megumu:
Yes, I am.

Sakuya:
Just what kind of motive would you have for making these things?

Megumu:
My motive...?
Why, they're my latest business venture, obviously.
It seems that people are quite enjoying them, so I'm in a rather cushy spot right now myself.

Sakuya:
Hmph, typical tengu. Simply the height of immorality.

Megumu:
Immoral?
I just copied a small part of people's souls. They shouldn't be posing any harm to anyone...

Sakuya:
Harm, hm...?
This isn't getting me anywhere. They're unpleasant, so would you mind recalling all of them?

Megumu:
I can't do that. The cards' circulation can't be stopped; not by me, at least.
Because everyone who's taking part in the card trade just started doing so of their own accord.
And I'm not the one controlling their circulation, either.
If you do seriously want to stop that circulation, I suggest you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.

Sakuya:
...Alright. You don't seem to be lying. Thanks for the information.

Tsukasa:
...Are you alright with this? Letting her leave, and reach that god?

Megumu:
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned, and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
I'm sure that girl just now will do a good job for us.

Tsukasa:
....Hahaha. I see.
When you betray someone, you don't do it with your own hands.
A wonderful idea, in my opinion.

Tsukasa:
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

Sakuya:
My, what a beautiful moon.
She said "even higher in the sky," but I certainly hope she didn't mean the moon.
The scary part is that that's actually plausible.

???:
Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

Sakuya:
...Who?

Chimata:
Chimata Tenkyuu. I'm the market's main presenter.

Sakuya:
The market's presenter... Good, I've finally found you.
You're the one in charge of the cards' circulation, then?

Chimata:
Quite so!
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're all able to buy and sell goods.

Sakuya:
In that case, I'd like you to halt circulation of these cards.

Chimata:
...Huh? Come again?

Tsukasa:
Miss Chimata. I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

Chimata:
What? Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah! It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

Tsukasa:
By which you mean?

Chimata:
I always knew that she was taking advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize that I was taking advantage of her right back!

Tsukasa:
Oho. How very interesting.
By the way, miss human.
I would suggest you pay careful attention to your remarks.
Miss Chimata is a god of the marketplace, and of commerce.
You have nothing whatsoever to gain from angering her.

Chimata:
*Giggle*. So, shall we begin?

Sakuya:
Begin what, exactly?

Chimata:
What do you mean, "what"...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

Sakuya:
Sell them?
No, that's not it. I want to stop everyone from selling them.
They're as unsettling as something could possibly be.
Recall all the cards this instant, and ban any further sale of them!

Chimata:
I see...
So, you were a robber seeking to destroy the marketplace? I certainly can't let that slide.
The fact that robbers like you exist is the reason why peace can never arrive.

Tsukasa:
Whoops. And even when I told you to watch what you say.
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

Chimata:
How unfortunate...
I can open a marketplace, sure,
but intervening in one is blasphemy against the market itself.
I can never forgive market-destroyers such as yourselves.
I absolutely guarantee free trade! That's what a market god is!

Chimata:
...You.
That card you're holding... It's mine...?!

Sakuya:
It's such an utterly useless card that I was just thinking about throwing it out.

Chimata:
"Useless?" Excuse you! It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
What an utterly interesting robber! It's a shame that you're going to die here!

Chimata:
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) ! This marks the end!

Sanae:
Wow, a rainbow!
The way it started raining all of a sudden was just the worst, but now my heart's as clear as the sky!

???:
Hey, Sis! Yeah, you over there!

Mike:
I've got some nice cards! Wanna buy any?

Sanae:
...Looks like I found you nice and fast. You're one of those card merchants.

Mike:
You've already heard? That makes things easy. I've got some rare cards lined up here! Better act fast.

Sanae:
I'm actually here to arrest the card merchants.

Mike:
Wha?!

Sanae:
Prepare thyself!

Mike:
Why?!
Practically everyone's getting in on the card trade!

Sanae:
Everyone?!

Mike:
You haven't heard? Oh, you're that shrine maiden from the mountain, aren'tcha.
I saw your Ability Card makin' the rounds too, as a matter of fact.

Sanae:
My own Ability Card?! Huh? T-that's...

Mike:
Defeatin' me won't do you any good. There are merchants all over the darn place.

Sanae:
That's a good point, actually. I've got to figure out who's making the cards...

Mike:
That said, though. Wanna buy a card off of me?
It could give you some kinda hint!

Sanae:
You've got good salesmanship for a cat...

Sanae:
The mountain youkai have been telling us not to go near here...
I never knew that there was a cliff with such a mystical atmosphere back here, though!

???:
Oh! You're little Sanae from the Moriyas' place, after all.
I thought I'd mistaken who you were, back there.

Sanae:
Excuse me, but who are you...?

Takane:
I'm Takane Yamashiro, the yamawaro! I helped you guys out with building your cable car.
So, what brings you here today?

Sanae:
I'd like to investigate a few things regarding those Ability Cards...
Oh, it looks like you've got some cards yourself.

Takane:
Cards, eh...?
I did think it was only a matter of time before the Moriya Shrine made their move...
But there's still a lotta money to be made off of these things. I can't let you take them!

Takane:
Good grief, you're strong...
But defeating me won't stop the cards from circulating!

Sanae:
There's no way to deal with them besides stamping you out one by one, though...
But I do know that the cards are spreading out from near the mountain.
I can't just leave things alone like this.
Right now, my only choice is to find merchants and gather information from them.

Takane:
I see. How about I sell you some info, then?
Some really, really special info.

Sanae:
Ooh! Gimme, gimme!

Takane:
Not so fast! I'm not giving it out for free. It's a very valuable tidbit (card) , after all.

???:
The hell's all this racket...?

???:
Get lost! You'll ruin the taste of my tobacco.

???:
You followed me all this way, huh?
Guess you're not just some ordinary rioter...

Sanae:
You're...

Sannyo:
My name's Sannyo. Folks like to call me Komakusa-dayuu, though.

Sanae:
Right, you're Miss Komakusa-dayuu! You run a gambling parlor for the tengu, and such.

Sannyo:
Oh? Well, if it isn't the Moriya shrine maiden.
You're not supposed to come up here, right? You're breaking your promise right now.

Sanae:
Yes, but this is an emergency situation.
There are bizarre cards circulating on the mountain, and it's disturbing the peace, or some such...
At any rate, it seems that the card market is centered around here.
I have to collect all the cards and contain the situation!

Sannyo:
Disturbing the peace? Contain the situation?

Sannyo:
Hmph. Who do you think you are? A mountain cop?
I'll have you know that the card market's a crucial part of the mountain's future.
You're the ones disturbing the mountain's peace! You Moriya Shrine folks!

Sannyo:
Grh. You're way too strong...

Sanae:
I'll be having you cooperate with my investigation.

Sannyo:
Not bad. It's no wonder that tengu has a high opinion of you.

Sanae:
By the way, what's that entrance I happen to see behind you?

Sannyo:
You haven't heard of the Rainbow Dragon Cave?
It's a cave with a mine full of dreams in it. A mine that'll build the mountain's future.

Sanae:
Huh? The Rainbow Dragon Cave? This is the first I've heard of it.

Sannyo:
Really?
I could've sworn I heard that the Moriya Shrine gods had their finger in that pie, too...

Sanae:
W-w-w-what? I haven't heard anything about that!

Sannyo:
Hey, hey, you can't go in there. It's more dangerous than you'd ever believe!
I don't care how strong you are. It's an awful environment for humans to be in.

Sanae:
No, I simply have to investigate this.
So if you have any good cards, I'd like to buy one!

Sannyo:
Heh. Well, alright. You'd better be real careful in there.

Sanae:
What is this place...?
I wonder if they're digging up something like coal?
They sure are lagging behind here... Even though we're already in the age of nuclear fusion.

???:
You there, human! Stop at once!

Misumaru:
You'll die if you proceed any further.
I'm telling you this for your own good. Turn around and leave, right now!

Sanae:
Who are you!?

Misumaru:
My name is Tamatsukuri, Young Sanae Kochiya.

Sanae:
So already you seem to know who I am.

Misumaru:
Yes, of course I do... So let me repeat my warning once again.
Beyond this point is an anoxic zone.
That means a human like you will cease to be able to breathe down there.
Will you still proceed, knowing that?

Sanae:
Anoxic!?
I had a bad feeling about this mine shaft from the start, but are there toxic gases too?

Misumaru:
Humans will quickly suffocate in any anoxic environment.
Whether there are toxic gases or not won't change the end result...
But yes, the shaft is indeed filled with toxic gas.

Sanae:
Really? Is it carbon monoxide or something, I wonder?

Misumaru:
Are you not scared? Have you forgotten that you might die?
Even though I warned you that lingering here would cause your demise?
Death by asphyxiation is a highly unpleasant way to go. Might I recommend a more palatable method!

Misumaru:
Hm, not bad.
I certainly didn't expect you to be this strong.
Young Sanae Kochiya.

Sanae:
...W-what is this...?
I can't... breathe...

Misumaru:
I told you, didn't I? That you'd suffocate if you stayed here?
The oxygen levels are already about half of that on the surface.
It seems that your brash show of skill has led you to forget your sense of danger.

Sanae:
...Just let me know one thing. What exactly are you mining here?
Gold? Silver? Coal? Iron? Bauxite? Or even Uranium?

Misumaru:
*Chuckle*. This is a mining site for dragon gems.
Dragon gems are so-called Izanagi Objects that have been handed down since ancient times.
They are ores that have existed since long before the birth of mankind, and are beyond human understanding.

Sanae:
...W-what the heeeck?
I have no idea what in the world you're talking about!

Misumaru:
By the way, you've come to investigate the Ability Cards, haven't you?
Then this cave isn't where you should be headed.
You ought to head back outside and seek the top of the mountain.
There's someone there who's been making profits off of magatama made from dragon gems!
I really do recommend taking some deep breaths up there.

???:
A human's here! See, it's just as I thought.
I knew we couldn't keep something like this up for long...!

Sanae:
Huff... huff...
It's not as bad as that mine shaft from before,
but it's still tough with the thin air up here.
I'm going to get altitude sickness.

???:
Why, what's this? A curious little thing just showed up.
You're the young miss from that shrine, aren't you?

Megumu:
As you already know, this isn't a place that humans ought to set foot in so easily.

Sanae:
You're a tengu-- no, a Great Tengu, aren't you.

Megumu:
Indeed, I am Iizunamaru, general of the crow tengu.

Sanae:
I'm sorry for trespassing in the domain of the tengu without permission.
However, as the origin of these cards seems to be somewhere on our mountain,
I have no choice but to enter tengu territory in order to investigate them.

Megumu:
Are you talking about the Ability Cards?

Sanae:
Yes, exactly! Do you happen to know anything?

Megumu:
I don't just "happen to know" about them.
I created them, as a matter of fact!

Sanae:
Huh? What did you say!?

???:
There you are!

Tsukasa:
See, things turned out just like I said they would.
A human would be sure to come snooping up here eventually!
I suppose we have no choice by now. I shall deal with this human myself.
So in the meantime, Master Iizunamaru, you can...

Megumu:
Ah-hah-hah! Don't get ahead of yourself.
You're too confident in your own strength, despite being a weakling.
If you got injured, I'd be the one troubled by it.
I'll deal with her. You get back!

Megumu:
Heh heh. Splendid.
I hereby surrender. As such, any further conflict is futile.

Sanae:
You're awfully direct...
Are you really the one who made the Ability Cards?

Megumu:
Yes, that's right.
I figured I could make a good profit using the dragon gems dug up from the Rainbow Dragon Cave, you know?
I've made enough money off of them by now, so I was guessing it'd be about time to pack up shop anyway.

Sanae:
Well, now! I've found the culprit, so that should be a relief for the time being.
Could I ask you to please stop circulating these cards before any further confusion breaks out?

Megumu:
That's the thing, I'm afraid. I can't stop the cards from circulating by myself.

Sanae:
Why is that?

Megumu:
Because everyone who's taking part in the card trade just started doing so of their own accord.
If you do seriously want to stop the cards' circulation...
I suggest you search for the mastermind, who's even higher up in the sky.
She's fully in charge of circulating the cards.

Sanae:
Is that right? There's still someone left...
I see. In that case, please excuse me...

Tsukasa:
...Are you alright with this? Letting her leave, and reach that god?

Megumu:
It's fine.
If I hadn't made effective use of her ability in the first place,
she'd still have been a washed-up shell of a god...
And yet she regained her power while my back was turned, and started trying to take over the rights to the cards!
She's made herself into just enough of a nuisance by now.
If the Moriya Shrine girl fights her, we'll benefit no matter which one loses.

Tsukasa:
....Hahaha. I see.
When you betray someone, you don't do it with your own hands.
A wonderful idea, in my opinion.

Tsukasa:
Master Iizunamaru betrayed her!
Things are really getting interesting!

Sanae:
What an unnatural moon.
Even the night being this bright is unusual.

???:
Welcome to the Lunar Rainbow Market.
You're the first marketeer to arrive this evening.

Sanae:
...And you are?

Chimata:
Chimata Tenkyuu. I'm the market's main presenter.

Sanae:
The market's presenter?

Chimata:
I'm a god who makes commerce possible on special occasions, such as when a rainbow appears.
It's thanks to my presence that you're all able to buy and sell goods.
Put another way, you're essentially alive right now because of me.

Sanae:
I see...? So what does that all...

Tsukasa:
Miss Chimata. I have a report for you.
....
....so she said.

Chimata:
What? Iizunamaru betrayed me?
Ah-hah-hah! It took you that long to realize, you lousy tengu?

Tsukasa:
By which you mean?

Chimata:
I always knew that she was taking advantage of me to make a profit.
But it looks like she was too slow to realize that I was taking advantage of her right back!

Tsukasa:
Oho. How very interesting.

Chimata:
You're Iizunamaru's pet, aren't you? Trot on back and tell her.
The market is already open.
None can escape from the hands of God!

Sanae:
Umm.
Did you forget about me?

Chimata:
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot.
Now then, shall we begin?

Sanae:
Huh? Begin what?

Chimata:
What do you mean, "what"...? Our transaction, of course.
You're here to sell the Ability Cards you've spent all this time stocking up, aren't you?

Sanae:
Sell them?
Oh, I see. You're that kind of god?
So you exchange collected cards into money...

Chimata:
Well, more or less.

Sanae:
Hmm, what to do... About how much are you offering, by the way?

Tsukasa:
Miss Sanae Kochiya. Miss Chimata is a god of the marketplace, and of commerce.
However, this marketplace is only open at certain times.
For instance, when a rainbow comes out, or when there's an intersection with an Otherworld.
I think it would be best if you sold a card, and received a set profit for it while you still can.
That would be more beneficial for you. That's what you're here for, isn't it?

Sanae:
*Gasp!* No, that's wrong!
I came here in order to halt the circulation of these cards!
You're the god of markets, aren't you?
If that's true, then stop these cards from circulating right now!

Tsukasa:
Whoops, you went and said something you shouldn't have.
*Giggle*. Don't say I didn't warn yooou.

Chimata:
I cannot halt their circulation.
Why, you ask? Because the rainbow is already encircling the moon.
To intervene in transactions now would be blasphemy against the market.
I'm afraid I must have you disbarred from this marketplace.
Let us return all things to nothing (God) ! By God's invisible hand!

Chimata:
...You.
That card you're holding... It's mine...?!

Sanae:
I bought it by complete mistake... I feel like crying.

Chimata:
"Feel like crying?" Excuse you! It's the one and only card that can control ownership.
But you've shown me something quite interesting! It's a shame that you're going to die here!

Chimata:
O wonderous human, who fears not even God.
The rainbow will close in just a few moments' time!
Finally, return even your life to nothing (God) ! This marks the end!

Tsukasa:
I let you off easy before, since you seemed useful......
But if you're going to cause trouble in the tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

Reimu:
I can't see the end no matter how much I go on...
Are they trying to fill the mountain with holes?

???:
You're... not Tsukasa.
Who are ya!?

Reimu:
I am the Hakurei shrine maiden, Reimu Hakurei!

???:
The Hakurei shrine maiden!?
Ahh, yep. That's her dumb face, all right.

Momoyo:
Heh-heh-heh. Beg your pardon. The name's Momoyo.
I'm the Rainbow Dragon Cave's foreman. So, what brings the Hakurei shrine maiden to see me?

Reimu:
You're the foreman? I totally thought that Misumaru person was in charge.

Momoyo:
"Misumaru"? Who's that?
*Gasp*, are they that thief Tsukasa mentioned?

Misumaru:
Ironic that you would call me a thief.
Isn't your band of youkai, led by an oomukade...
The ones who are digging up the Youkai Mountain and stealing the Izanagi Objects?

Momoyo:
Another one of ya!? Who are you!?

Misumaru:
I am Misumaru Tamatsukuri, the rightful owner of the dragon gems.
Your actions have been wholly unacceptable.

Momoyo:
Whazzat? Rightful owner?

Momoyo:
Another one! You thieves are just pilin' on in here, aren'tcha?

Tsukasa:
Miss Momoyo, I'm not a thief. I'm Tsukasa.
This colorful "Misumaru" character is the thief that I mentioned.
She's colluding with the human before you to steal all the dragon gems from the mountain.

Reimu:
Eh? Hang on, what are you saying?
I just came to investigate the cards...

Tsukasa:
At this rate, we'll have no choice but to close down the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
But Master Iizunamaru doesn't know about this yet.
I shall return and report to her, so that she may pass her judgement.

Momoyo:
*Chuckle*. Hang on.
You just said that Iizunamaru doesn't know about these two being here, yeah?

Tsukasa:
......That is correct.

Momoyo:
Well, ain't this a chance to go all out?
We don't need the tengu's judgement just for some petty thieves. I can make the call myself.
I'll pummel 'em into the dirt here and now!

Tsukasa:
......

Misumaru:
How unfortunate. We're about to get into a pointless fight, thanks to that fox's prodding.
Your opponent is an oomukade, a disgusting youkai that eats even dragons.
You must win against her. Let me lend you a bit of strength.

Misumaru:
Have you chosen a good card? Well then, Reimu Hakurei, brace yourself and fight!

Reimu:
Wai-- Why am I getting roped into this!?

Momoyo:
Are you finished getting ready? You cowardly thief!

Reimu:
I'm not a thief, but I guess I just have to roll with it at this point.

Momoyo:
I've been looking for someone who I'm allowed to fight without holding anything back!
Tremble in joy! The mountain shall be your grave!

Momoyo:
...That...
felt AWESOME!
Thanks for letting me shoot all the danmaku I could ever want!

Reimu:
Ugh, I really got put through the wringer... Why did I end up having to fight you, anyway?

Momoyo:
Give the jokes a rest!
Someone who hates fighting wouldn't have been moving nearly as fiercely as you were just now.
You might be a thief, but I'll always give a warm welcome to tough customers!
Come and steal your fill whenever you please, at the Rainbow Dragon Cave!

Reimu:
Like I said, I'm not a thief!

Momoyo:
You're not a thief?
......
Then why'd you come all the way down here?

Reimu:
...Mmmm.
I'm here to investigate these mines.

Momoyo:
Again with those jokes!
If you just came to investigate,
then you could've just run away when I began attacking!

Reimu:
......Ah!
I hadn't thought of that.

Momoyo:
Hahaha! You're definitely one of my favorites!
Let me introduce you to Iizunamaru!
She's a total combat-lover, just like you.

Reimu:
By the way, who was that Misumaru lady, after all?

Momoyo:
Oh, I see. So she really wasn't some friend of yours...?
Well, whatever. If I ever find her, we'll just have another fight like today!
When that time comes, we can fight her together!

Reimu:
No thank you.

Tsukasa:
I let you off easy before, since you seemed useful......
But if you're going to cause trouble in the tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

Marisa:
Maan. I might've underestimated the tengu's persistence, huh.
Is it even possible to dig this deep?
Are they seriously diggin' this deep?

???:
You're... not Tsukasa.
Who are ya!?

Marisa:
Behold! I am the magician who makes even silent children cry, Marisa Kirisame!

???:
...Huh. Never heard of ya.

Marisa:
Who are you?

Momoyo:
Ah, beg your pardon. The name's Momoyo.
I'm the Rainbow Dragon Cave's foreman.

Marisa:
Foreman? I see... well that's convenient.
I wanna ask about those dragon gems you've been mining here.
And I'm hopin' you might be able to share some.

Momoyo:
Dragon gems, y'say?
Are you that thief that Tsukasa mentioned?

Misumaru:
Be careful!
That oomukade is extremely dangerous, young Marisa Kirisame!

Momoyo:
Another one of ya!? Who are you!?

Misumaru:
I am Misumaru Tamatsukuri, the rightful owner of the dragon gems.
Your actions have been wholly unacceptable.

Momoyo:
Whazzat? Rightful owner?

Momoyo:
Another one! You thieves are just pilin' on in here, aren'tcha?

Tsukasa:
Miss Momoyo, I'm not a thief. I'm Tsukasa.
This colorful "Misumaru" character is the thief that I mentioned.
She's colluding with the human before you to steal all the dragon gems from the mountain.

Marisa:
Eh? What are you talking about?
I was just thinking about taking a tiny bit...

Tsukasa:
At this rate, we'll have no choice but to close down the Rainbow Dragon Cave.
But Master Iizunamaru doesn't know about this yet.
I shall return and report to her, so that she may pass her judgement.

Momoyo:
*Chuckle*. Hang on.
You just said that Iizunamaru doesn't know about these two being here, yeah?

Tsukasa:
......That is correct.

Momoyo:
Well, ain't this a chance to go all out?
We don't need the tengu's judgement just for some petty thieves. I can make the call myself.
I'll pummel 'em into the dirt here and now!

Tsukasa:
......

Misumaru:
That fox has led the conversation in a strange direction...
Your opponent is an oomukade, a disgusting youkai that eats even dragons.
You must win against her. Let me lend you a bit of strength.

Misumaru:
Have you chosen a good card? Well then, Marisa Kirisame, brace yourself and fight!

Marisa:
Wait a minute!
You're gonna share some of those dragon gems with me if I win, right?

Momoyo:
Very well! If you win, I'll give you some.
I'll always give a warm welcome to thieves who play fair and square!

Marisa:
Haah, thanks...

Momoyo:
But it doesn't matter! There's no way I would lose.
Tremble in joy! The mountain shall be your grave!

Momoyo:
...That...
felt AWESOME!

Marisa:
Yes! I won!

Momoyo:
That was a blast! I got to shoot all the danmaku I could ever want!

Marisa:
You didn't forget, right? Our promise?

Momoyo:
Promise? What was it, again...?

Marisa:
That you'd share the dragon gems with me!

Momoyo:
Ah, ahh, well... I guess a bit won't hurt.

Marisa:
Yeah!

Momoyo:
Keep it a secret from Iizunamaru, okay?

Tsukasa:
......

Momoyo:
Woah! Where did you come from!

Tsukasa:
Miss Momoyo, you fought a splendid battle.
If even your might wasn't enough to defeat her, I suppose we have no choice.
But I doubt Master Iizunamaru would stay silent about it if you let her have the dragon gems.

Momoyo:
I like how strong this one is.
So I'm gonna do what she wants.
You got a problem with that?

Tsukasa:
......

Momoyo:
As long as you stay silent about it, I'm guessin' we don't have a problem. Right, Tsukasa?

Tsukasa:
My, my. If Miss Momoyo is threatening me, I suppose I'll have to oblige.
I can't possibly win, after all.

Momoyo:
Heh, not bad. You smart folks really are different.

Marisa:
Is it just me, or is this conversation getting kind of murky?
I was really just hopin' to get the teensiest bit of it.
Just out of, uh, academic curiosity...

Momoyo:
If you want more dragon gems, come on back any time!
Let's have a rematch!

Marisa:
I have to fight you again!?

Tsukasa:
I let you off easy before, since you seemed useful......
But if you're going to cause trouble in the tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

Sakuya:
I can breathe just fine.
It seems like this magatama card's power is the real deal.

???:
You're... not Tsukasa.
Who are ya!?

Sakuya:
I am Sakuya Izayoi, employed at the Scarlet Devil Mansion as a maid.

???:
...Huh. Never heard of ya.

Sakuya:
I would imagine so. And you are?

Momoyo:
Ah, beg your pardon. The name's Momoyo.
I'm the Rainbow Dragon Cave's foreman.

Sakuya:
The foreman? I see...
So that Misumaru person wasn't in charge.

Momoyo:
"Misumaru"? Who's that?
*Gasp*, are they that thief Tsukasa mentioned?

Misumaru:
Ironic that you would call me a thief.
Isn't your band of youkai, led by an oomukade...
The ones who are digging up the Youkai Mountain and stealing the Izanagi Objects?

Momoyo:
Another one of ya!? Who are you!?

Misumaru:
I am Misumaru Tamatsukuri, the rightful owner of the dragon gems.
Your actions have been wholly unacceptable.

Momoyo:
Whazzat? Rightful owner?

Momoyo:
Another one! You thieves are just pilin' on in here, aren'tcha?

Tsukasa:
Miss Momoyo, I'm not a thief. I'm Tsukasa.
This colorful "Misumaru" character is the thief that I mentioned.
She's colluding with the human before you to steal all the dragon gems from the mountain.

Sakuya:
...

Tsukasa:
But Master Iizunamaru doesn't know about this yet.
I shall return and report to her, so that she may pass her judgement.

Momoyo:
*Chuckle*. Hang on.
You just said that Iizunamaru doesn't know about these two being here, yeah?

Tsukasa:

Momoyo:
Well, ain't this a chance to go all out?
We don't need the tengu's judgement just for some petty thieves. I can make the call myself.
I'll pummel 'em into the dirt here and now!

Tsukasa:
......

Sakuya:
Ah, I see. Everyone seems to be being played against each other by that lying fox.
I am not a thief, and it's likely that Misumaru isn't one either.
The Great Tengu you call Iizunamaru also doesn't wish for any battle, either.

Momoyo:
Ahahah! No way!
Iizunamaru loves to fight!
And I don't really care if you guys are thieves or not.
I just want a good fight, myself!

Misumaru:
It seems that a battle is unavoidable.
You must win against her. Let me lend you a bit of strength.

Misumaru:
Have you chosen a good card? Well then, Sakuya Izayoi, brace yourself and fight!

Sakuya:
Wh-- Please wait!
I really just wanted to talk to Misumaru...

Momoyo:
Are you done preparing?

Sakuya:
Fine. We just have to fight, yes?

Momoyo:
I've been looking for someone who I'm allowed to fight without holding anything back!
Tremble in joy! The mountain shall be your grave!

Momoyo:
...That...
felt AWESOME!
That was a blast! I got to shoot all the danmaku I could ever want!

Sakuya:
Don't underestimate maids!

Momoyo:
A "maid", huh? So maids were a race of ferocious butchers.

Sakuya:
It's not a race, it's an occupation.
Now then, I had some business with Misumaru, but...

Momoyo:
Misumaru's that lady who made a break for it just now, right?
Who was she?

Sakuya:
Who knows... I have no idea either.
Our resident witch told me to come here and look into it, but...

Misumaru:
...You called?

Momoyo:
Woah! Where did you come from!

Misumaru:
I was quietly watching your violent behaviour from over there.

Sakuya:
Wonderful. I have quite a lot to ask you.
First, do you know about the relationship between the dragon gems and the Ability Cards?

Misumaru:
The cards are a type of magic item that the great tengu created.
They seem to be utilizing dragon gems, which can seal souls within them,
but the detailed mechanism behind them is a mystery to me.
After all, the dragon gems alone shouldn't be sufficient for maintaining the cards' supply of magic.

Sakuya:
I see... Thank you so much. Next is about the Izanagi Objects.

Misumaru:
An Izanagi Object is...

Momoyo:
Oi, oi. If you're gonna drone on about boring stuff, feel free to do it outside.

Sakuya:
Ah, excuse us.
Miss Misumaru, do you mind coming to the Scarlet Devil Mansion?
Our resident witch may barrage you with questions, mind.

Misumaru:
Very well.
Ah yes, about your prior question.
Izanagi Objects are dangerous, so it's best to not dig them up.

Sakuya:
Eh? What did you just...

Tsukasa:
I let you off easy before, since you seemed useful......
But if you're going to cause trouble in the tunnels, I've got no more use for you!
Die like the pitiful human you are!

Sanae:
Lady Kanako seems to have accepted the Ability Cards,
but it is really alright to ignore the mining here?

???:
You're... not Tsukasa.
Who are ya!?

Sanae:
I am Sanae Kochiya, the Moriya Shrine maiden.

???:
The Moriya Shrine, huh?
Ahh, yep. That's your despicable face, all right.

Momoyo:
Heh-heh-heh. Beg your pardon. The name's Momoyo.
I'm the Rainbow Dragon Cave's foreman. And I'm pretty sure the Moriya Shrine has no business here, yeah?

Sanae:
There's something I personally want to know about the mineral being mined here.

Momoyo:
Personally?
Then why'd you introduce yourself as the Moriya shrine maiden?

Sanae:
Oh, that was just out of habit...

Misumaru:
Be careful!
That oomukade is extremely dangerous, young Sanae Kochiya!

Momoyo:
Another one of ya!? Who are you!?

Misumaru:
I am Misumaru Tamatsukuri, the rightful owner of the dragon gems.
Your actions have been wholly unacceptable.

Momoyo:
Whazzat? Rightful owner?

Momoyo:
Another one! You thieves are just pilin' on in here, aren'tcha?

Tsukasa:
Miss Momoyo, I'm not a thief. I'm Tsukasa.
This colorful "Misumaru" character is the thief that I mentioned.

You must win against her. Let me lend you a bit of strength.

Misumaru:
Have you chosen a good card? Well then, Sanae Kochiya, brace yourself and fight!

Sanae:
...
So many characters keep showing up that I can barely get a word in!

Momoyo:
Are you finished getting ready? You cowardly thief!

Sanae:
I just wanted to know about the minerals being dug out here...

Momoyo:
Then I shall tell you! If you win, that is.
Tremble in joy! Your resting place shall be beneath your own shrine!

Momoyo:
...That...
felt AWESOME!
Thanks for letting me shoot all the danmaku I could ever want!
Dang, I guess the Moriya Shrine ain't so bad either.
Even though Iizunamaru's always badmouthin' the place.

Sanae:
Eh? Did you say something?

Momoyo:
It was nothin'.
Ah yeah, our promise.

Sanae:
Hm? Promise? What promise?

Momoyo:
Oi, oi. Did you lose your memory from grazin' too many bullets?
You said you wanted to know more about the stuff we're diggin' up here, right?

Sanae:
Ahh.

Momoyo:
This is a dragon gem mine. It's a prime spot for getting dragon gems, which are a rare earth element.
They react to different types of magic an' give off different glows in response.

Sanae:
Huh, that sounds beautiful.

Momoyo:
Well they are! But that's not all.
They glow in different colors 'cause they're copying the magic.
Using dragon gems lets you copy others' abilities.

Sanae:
I see, and that's how the Ability Cards work...

Momoyo:
Well, they can copy the magic, but apparently you can't activate 'em on their own.
I dunno how they completed the Ability Cards, myself.
I think Iizunamaru said that... they made use of the market god's power.

Sanae:
...I understand. Thank you so much.
Umm, what was your name again?

Momoyo:
Me? I'm Momoyo Himemushi.

Sanae:
You're much more kind than your appearance lets on, Miss Momoyo.
I didn't think you'd honor your promise, judging from how you look.

Momoyo:
You pickin' a fight with me?
Perfect! I'll take you up on that offer! Time for a rematch, right now!

Sanae:
Ah, I'm sorry. Your looks weren't deceiving, after all.
